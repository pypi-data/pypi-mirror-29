fithic_1.0.8.tgz - 12/11/2017 #Thank you to Ye Zheng for bringing
                                this to our attention!
-------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
1. Isotonic regression is now strictly antitonic. 
~~~During the spline fit phase of fithic, we are looking to smooth
the contacts to a monotonically decreasing function. Previously,
the IsotonicRegression function from sklearn was not making this
assumption, and was empirically determining if the function
was isotonic(increasing) or antitonic(decreasing). While it would
typically determine it is antitonic and proceed normally, Ye found
a case where the function determined the flip (isotonic) and this
led to significant influences on fithic's 'significant contacts' 
determination. 

It should be obvious when this has occured, as the
results would be significantly different; however, it is still 
recommended all users update ASAP.

fithic_1.0.9.tgz - 12/19/2017 
-------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
1. Modified isotonic regression such that it's not version
independent

fithic_1.1.0.tgz - 1/11/2018
-------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
1. Modified file parser to accept decimal's such that it works 
with hicpro2fithic.py script
__________________________________________________________________

fithic_1.1.1.tgz - 1/11/2018
-------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
1. Thought of better fix to the problem addressed in 1.1.0
__________________________________________________________________

fithic_1.1.2.tgz - 02/05/2018
-------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
1. Fixed issue with optional import of matplotlib and pylab
2. Made input compression agnostic (you don't have to gzip input
files anymore! But we still highly recommend it!)

Special thanks to aakashsur for all the ideas!

fithic_1.1.3.tgz - 02/20/2018
-------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
1. Fixed a persistent and vastly annoying bug with -x All 
and -x intersOnly and p-values
2. Makes default value of -l option 'fithic' so files are
not hidden any longer
3. Makes default value of -o option './FITHICOUTPUT' so 
users don't lose their output to the abyss
4. Attempted to fix matplotlib plotting issues per aakashsur's
issues. Unclear if it will work for all matplotlib versions.
Still an area of active work.

Updates:
1. README updated - it's pretty now! check it out!
2. utils/ folder added to fithic contains two scripts
    1. hicpro2fithic.py - a Python script to convert 
    hicpro output to input for fithic. Also found in the
    hicpro github
    2. Create_Fragments_File.py - a Python script to 
    automatically generate the fragsfile for Hi-C
    data given a chromsome sizes file and a 
    resolution for the data
3. Added whole genome dataset to tests/ folder to test
for interchromosomal interactions as well
4. Added parasite dataset to tests/ folder to test for
edge cases

Special thanks to Vikash and Moshe for pointing out and helping 
debug bug #1!
