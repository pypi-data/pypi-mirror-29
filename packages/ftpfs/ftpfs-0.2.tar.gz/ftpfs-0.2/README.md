ftpfs
-----

I needed to `rsync` something into an FTP server and `curlftpfs`, the only
FTP over FUSE implementation I know of, has [failed me
completely](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curlftpfs/+bug/888153).

Highlights:

- Worked for me once so it must be completely bug-free
- I'll ~~fix bugs you encounter~~ implement features you need
  if you provide me with a test FTP server
- No symlinks support

Installation:

>`pip install ftpfs --user`
>
>or
>
>```
>git clone https://github.com/rr-/ftpfs
>cd ftpfs
>pip install --user .
>```

Usage:

>`ftpfs host mountpoint` (will ask for credentials interactively)
>
>or
>
>`ftpfs host mountpoint --user foo --pass bar`

If you wish to run it in background, add `--daemon`.
