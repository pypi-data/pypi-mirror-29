Run `thanks` on your requirements.txt to find ways to support the developers
who are supporting your code. ðŸ’š

## Contributing

The best way to contribute is to add info to `thanks/thanks.json` about
contributors, matching PyPI usernames to URLs.

The second best way is to add whatever you think will make this library more
useful. I will happily accept PRs for tests, better functionality, better output
formatting, etc.
