        ### QSPR MODELING: APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALOGRITHMS IN CLASSIFYING THE FAMILY AND PREDICTING FLASH POINTS AND CETANE NUMBER OF BIOFUEL COMPOUNDS
        
        ### Introduction
        
        This Biofuel Software will predict the family of the input chemicals and predict thermo-physical properties (flash point and cetane number) according to the family. The GUI is designed by using tkinter. Numerical regression and classification methods, including MLPR, GRNN, OLS, PLS, KNN, SVM, LDA, are used in the machine learning approach to make better predictions of family and properties.
        
        ### Usage
        
        To predict the family and the thermo-physical properties of the imported molecule, user can run the software following the instructions below.
        1. Git clone our GitHub address `git clone https://github.com/Zhangjt9317/Biofuel-Group-Project.git`;
        2. Then, users input `cd Biofuel-Group-Project/MyProject` command into bash;
        3. Next, users input `python Project_GUI.py` command to open the Graphic User Interface;
        4. Enter the `CID number` of that chemical and click `Get CID` to comfirm input. if `Get CID` is not clicked, no CID will be gotten for the machine learning models;
        5. Click `Model selection` to chose differient machine learning methods and properties, and then click `Begin` to confirm selection;
        6. Then click `Result` to plot the training and predction result.
