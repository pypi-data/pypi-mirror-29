        ===========
        
        ActivitySim is an open platform for activity-based travel modeling.  It emerged
        from a consortium of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and other
        transportation planning agencies that wanted to build a shared, open, platform
        that could be easily adapted to their individual needs, but would share a
        robust, efficient, and well-maintained common core.
