PyGLM ( WIP )
=============

A semi-complete implementation of OpenGL Mathematics (GLM).

Why "semi-complete"? - PyGLM is missing some features because I wasn't able to 
implement them properly or ignored them, because I thought they weren't going
to be used by anyone anyway (like glm::tvec1).
If you want to request features, please create an issue on the issue tracker.

PyGLM is still in development (hence the WIP).

To install PyGLM, just use the default PyPI procedure.

    pip install PyGLM


To import PyGLM's functions, simply use 'import glm'.

Example:

    import glm

    v = glm.vec3()

    v.x = 7

    z = v.xxx

    print(z)
