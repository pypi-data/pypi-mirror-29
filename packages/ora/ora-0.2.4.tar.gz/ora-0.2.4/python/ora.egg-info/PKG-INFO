Description: 
        Ora is a coherent and high-perforamance C++ and Python 3 library for times,
        dates, time zones, and related concepts.  The central concept is a
        location-independent instant of time.  Local date and time of day
        representations are derived from this, using the (included) zoneinfo database.
        Multiple resolutions are provided for all time types.
        
        .. code:: py
        
            >>> import ora
            >>> time = ora.now()
            >>> print(time)
            2017-12-26T03:47:36.41359399Z
            >>> tz = ora.TimeZone("US/Eastern")
            >>> (time @ tz).date
