video thumbnails generator written in Python, based on ffmpeg.

Getting thumbup
---------------

.. code-block:: 

  pip install thumbup

You'll need ``ffmpeg`` before you can use ``thumbup``, which can be installed by

.. code-block:: shell

  # on macOS
  brew install ffmpeg
  # on ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

``ffmpeg`` is also widely available for many other distros. Please refer to the official website https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html.

Usage
-----

To generate thumbnails for video files, use

.. code-block::

  thumbup file1 file2

The above will create ``file1.jpg`` and ``file2.jpg``.

To generate thumbnails for all video files in directory ``dir``, use ``-R`` option. ``thumbup`` will recursively go through every video in directory ``dir`` and generate thumbnails next to them.

.. code-block::

  thumbup -R dir
