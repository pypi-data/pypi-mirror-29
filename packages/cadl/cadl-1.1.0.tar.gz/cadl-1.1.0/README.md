# Troubleshooting

## Error: alsa/asoundlib.h: No such file or directory

```
  src/RtMidi.cpp:1101:28: fatal error: alsa/asoundlib.h: No such file or directory
  compilation terminated.
  error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

This is a dependency of `magenta` (`python-rtmidi`) which requires `libasound`.

### Solution: Install ALSA

CentOS:

```
sudo yum install alsa-lib-devel alsa-utils
```

Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

## Error: jack/jack.h: No such file or directory

```
src/RtMidi.cpp:2448:23: fatal error: jack/jack.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
```

### Solution: Install Jack

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install libjack-dev
```
