flask-snow
============

Adds ServiceNow support to Flask.

**Why?**

Simplicity and responsiveness are two key ingredients to a successful UX, I believe the ServiceNow UI lacks both.


**What can be done differently with flask-snow?**

It lets you create a fully customizable Flask-powered platform on top of the ServiceNow REST API in a simple and seamless way with the help of the `pysnow library <https://github.com/rbw0/pysnow>`_.

Some usage examples:

- Create *your own software stack* that integrates with ServiceNow.
- Add ServiceNow support to *your current Flask project*.
- Create a *micro-service API relay*, and perhaps use with a project *written in another language*.
