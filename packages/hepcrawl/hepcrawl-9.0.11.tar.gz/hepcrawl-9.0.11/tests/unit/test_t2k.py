        "Japan, running 295 km from the J-PARC facility in Tokai to the Super-"
        "Kamiokande detector in the Kamioka mine. The near detector will be "
        "installed on the J-PARC site during 2009, and has been designed to "
        "measure the neutrino flux, through charged current neutrino "
        "interactions, as well as the neutral current \u03c0 0 cross-section. "
        "To make these measurements, the calorimeters must reconstruct muons "
        "and photons with high efficiency, and it has been shown that 90% "
        "efficiency can be achieved for muons above 100 MeV and 80% for photons "
        "over 150 MeV. These are the two particles most important for the "
        "planned measurements; electrons are also very important and are "
        "expected to have efficiencies similar to photons. The efficiency "
        "deteriorates for particles with less energy, but this is clearly shown "
        "to be caused by the minimal signal created in the detector. To "
        "validate the Monte Carlo characterisation of the calorimeter, the same "
        "reconstruction methods were applied to data from the SciBooNE "
        "experiment. With the aim of measuring neutrino interaction cross-"
        "sections, the SciBooNE experiment was based at FermiLab in Illinois "
        "and used the Booster Neutrino Beam. One of SciBooNE\u2019s detectors "
        "was the SciBar, a scintillating plastic detector similar in design to "
        "T2K\u2019s calorimeter. The reconstruction showed 100% efficiency for "
        "locating charged muon tracks, with excellent position and direction "

        "photon showers."
