Description: 
        localimport allows you to import Python modules in an isolated
        environment, preserving the global importer state.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        -  Emulates an isolated environment for Python module imports
        -  Evaluates ``*.pth`` files
        -  Compatible with ``pkg_resources`` namespaces
        -  Mocks ``pkgutil.extend_path()`` to support zipped Python eggs
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Given your Python script, application or plugin comes with a directory
        that contains modules for import, you can use localimport to keep the
        global importer state clean.
        
        ::
        
            app.py
            res/modules/
              some_package/
                __init__.py
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # app.py
            with localimport('res/modules') as _importer:
              import some_package
            assert 'some_package' not in sys.modules
        
            **Important**: You must keep the reference to the ``localimport``
            object alive, especially if you use ``from xx import yy`` imports.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        | In most cases it would not make sense to use ``localimport`` as a
          Python module when you actually want to import Python modules since
          the import of the ``localimport`` module itself would not be isolated.
        | The solution is to use the ``localimport`` source code directly in
          your application code. Usually you will use a minified version.
        
        Pre-minified versions of ``localimport`` can be found in this
        `Gist <http://bitly.com/localimport-min>`__. Of course you can minify
        the code by yourself, for example using the
        `nr <https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/py-nr>`__ command-line tools.
        
        ::
        
            nr py.blob localimport.py -cme localimport > localimport-gzb64-w80.py
        
        Depending on your application, you may want to use a bootstrapper entry
        point.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # @@@ minified localimport here @@@
        
            with localimport('.') as _importer:
              _importer.disable('my_application_package')
              from my_application_package.__main__ import main
              main()
        
        API
        ===
        
        ``localimport(path, parent_dir=None, do_eggs=True, do_pth=True, do_autodisable=True)``
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
            A context manager that creates an isolated environment for importing
            Python modules. Once the context manager exits, the previous global
            state is restored.
        
            Note that the context can be entered multiple times, but it is not
            recommended generally as the only case where you would want to do
            that is inside a piece of code that gets executed delayed (eg. a
            function) which imports a module, and building the isolated
            environment and restoring to the previous state has some performance
            impacts.
        
            Also note that the context will only remove packages on exit that
            have actually been imported from the list of paths specified in the
            *path* argument, but not modules from the standard library, for
            example.
        
            **Parameters**
        
            -  *path* – A list of paths that are added to ``sys.path`` inside
               the context manager. Can also be a single string. If one or more
               relative paths are passed, they are treated relative to the
               *parent\_dir* argument.
            -  *parent\_dir* – A path that is concatenated with relative paths
               passed to the *path* argument. If this argument is omitted or
               ``None``, it will default to the parent directory of the file
               that called the ``localimport()`` constructor (using
               ``sys._getframe(1).f_globals['__file__']``).
            -  *do\_eggs* – A boolean that indicates whether ``.egg`` files or
               directories found in the additional paths are added to
               ``sys.path``.
            -  *do\_pth* – A boolean that indicates whether ``.pth`` files found
               in the additional paths will be evaluated.
            -  *do\_autodisable* – A boolean that indicates that
               ``localimport.autodisable()`` should be called automatically be
               the context manager.
        
            *Changed in 1.7* Added ``do_autodisable`` parameter.
        
        ``localimport.autodisable()``
        -----------------------------
        
            Uses ``localimport.discover()`` to automatically detect modules that
            could be imported from the paths in the importer context and calls
            #disable on all of them.
        
            *New in 1.7*
        
        ``localimport.disable(modules)``
        --------------------------------
        
            Disable one or more modules by moving them from the global module
            cache (``sys.modules``) to a dictionary of temporary hidden modules
            in the isolated environment. Once the ``localimport()`` context
            manager exits, these modules will be restored. Does nothing when a
            module does not exist.
        
            **Parameters**
        
            -  *modules* – A list of module names or a single module name
               string.
        
        ``localimport.discover()``
        --------------------------
        
            A shorthand for ``pkgutil.walk_packages(importer.path)``.
        
            *New in 1.7*
