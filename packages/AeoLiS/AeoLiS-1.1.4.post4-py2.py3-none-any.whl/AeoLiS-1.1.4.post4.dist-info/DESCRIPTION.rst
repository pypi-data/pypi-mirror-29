AeoLiS
======

AeoLiS is a process-based model for simulating aeolian sediment
transport in situations where supply-limiting factors are important,
like in coastal environments. Supply-limitations currently supported
are soil moisture contents, sediment sorting and armouring, bed slope
effects, air humidity and roughness elements.

AeoLiS is initially developed by `Bas Hoonhout
<bas.hoonhout@deltares.nl>`_ at `Delft University of Technology
<http://www.tudelft.nl>`_ with support from the ERC-Advanced Grant
291206 Nearshore Monitoring and Modeling (`NEMO
<http://nemo.citg.tudelft.nl>`_) and `Deltares
<http://www.deltares.nl>`_. AeoLiS is currently maintained by `Bas
Hoonhout <bas.hoonhout@deltares.nl>`_ at Deltares and `Sierd de Vries
<Sierd.deVries@tudelft.nl>`_ at Delft University of Technology.
