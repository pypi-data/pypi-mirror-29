TosKer
======

TosKer is an orchestrator engine capable of automatically deploying and managing multi-component applications specifies in `OASIS TOSCA <https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca>`__, by exploiting `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`__ as a lightweight virtualization framework.
The novelty of TosKer is to decouple the application-specific components, from the containers used to build their infrastructure.
This permits to improve the orchestration of the components and to ease the change of the containers underneath.
