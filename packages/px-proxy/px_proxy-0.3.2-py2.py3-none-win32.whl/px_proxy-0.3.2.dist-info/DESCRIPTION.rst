Px is a HTTP(s) proxy server that allows applications to authenticate through an NTLM proxy server, typically used in corporate deployments, without having to deal with the actual NTLM handshake. It is primarily designed to run on Windows systems and authenticates on behalf of the application using the currently logged in Windows user account.
