Description: ==============================
        Web-based UNIX password change
        ==============================
        
        This packages provides a web UI for the UNIX ``passwd`` command, e.g. so that
        SFTP-only user accounts can still change their password.
        
        WARNING: The passwords are passed in plaintext via popen from the CGI process to
        the helper process that runs under sudo. So maybe don't use this in an
        adversarial environment where people might spy on your process list or something.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Set up your webserver to run the CGI script. Here's an example apache
        configuration snippet::
        
            ScriptAlias /passwd /path/to/venv/bin/webpasswd-cgi
        
        As changing the password for another user requires root access, you also need to
        setup passwordless sudo execution for the ``webpasswd-change`` helper.
        Add a rule like this, e.g. in ``/etc/sudoers.d/webpasswd``::
        
            www-data ALL=NOPASSWD:/path/to/venv/bin/webpasswd-change
        
        (``www-data`` means the user the webserver executing the CGI script runs as.)
        
        You can pass the following environment variables to the CGI script:
        
        :WEBPASSWD_CHANGE: Path to ``webpasswd-change`` helper. If unset, assumes
            a virtualenv installation (so it's located next to ``webpasswd-cgi``)
        :WEBPASSWD_STYLESHEET: URL to a stylesheet to link to instead of using the
            built-in styles
        
        
        Running tests
        =============
        
        You'll need to add a user account ``webpasswd``, and interactively during the
        test run reset its password as instructed.
