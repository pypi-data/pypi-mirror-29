Changes
=======

1.3.2.3 (2018-02-28)
--------------------

- Fix Python 3 deprecation warnings.

- Add an API to explicitly close the connection to the server.

1.3.2.2 (2018-01-17)
--------------------

- Make sure to pass a unicode filename to ConfigParser. This prevents a
  warning under Python 2.7.14.

1.3.2.1 (2018-01-17)
--------------------

- Python 3 compatibility. The adapter now formally supports Python 2.7 and
  Python 3.6 through the `six` compatibility layer..

1.2.1 (2017-10-16)
------------------

- Koppeltaal server does not properly format message headers for
  CreateOrUpdateActivityDefinition, add a fix to still allow those
  messages.

1.2 (2017-08-30)
----------------

- Add Organization resource.

- Add support for careProvider and managingOrganization on Patient
  resource.

- Add support for birthDate, gender and organization on Practitioner
  resource.

- Add a DummyConnector. This has the same API than a connector but
  does not do anything. That's useful when you want to make sure your
  application works, but cannot talk to the Koppeltaal server.
