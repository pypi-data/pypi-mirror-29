MODULE DESCRIPTION:

Test whether CALL return value is checked.

For direct calls, the Solidity compiler auto-generates this check. E.g.:

    Alice c = Alice(address);  
    c.ping(42);

Here the CALL will be followed by IZSERO(retval), if retval = ZERO then state is reverted.

For low-level-calls this check is omitted. E.g.:

    c.call.value(0)(bytes4(sha3("ping(uint256)")),1);
