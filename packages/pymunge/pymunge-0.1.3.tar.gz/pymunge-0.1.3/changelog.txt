Version 0.1.3 (2018-02-18)
--------------------------

* Fixed description formatting on PyPI.

Version 0.1.2 (2018-02-18)
--------------------------

Major new features:

* Added Python 2 support. (Python 3.4+ is still the main target.)
* Added API documentation at https://pymunge.readthedocs.io/
  (also buildable locally with Sphinx).

Incompatible changes:

* Module pymunge.native has been renamed to pymunge.raw.
* pymunge.raw can now be imported even if libmunge cannot be found;
  in the latter case calling any libmunge function causes an
  ImportError. To check if the library was found, import pymunge.raw
  and check whether pymunge.raw.libmunge is None.
* The raw functions munge_ctx_get and munge_ctx_set now automatically
  wrap their first two arguments with the correct C types (i.e.
  munge_ctx_t, munge_opt_t). The caller must not wrap them that way
  anymore (and instead should just pass integers), otherwise the call
  will fail with a type error due to repeated wrapping with C types.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a segfault on certain platforms when getting or setting
  context options.
* The "setup.py clean" command now accepts standard arguments. This
  fixes incompatibilities with certain packaging tools (e.g. stdeb).
* Fixed tests not being included in source distribution.

Other changes:

* Added enum34 as install requirement on Python versions before 3.4.
* Improved many docstrings and some parts of the readme

Version 0.1.1 (2017-12-28)
--------------------------

* Initial release.
