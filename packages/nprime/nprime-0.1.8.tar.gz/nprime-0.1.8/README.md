- Prime generating functions
- Miller Rabin predictive algorithm

## Specifications

### Integration and pipeline

Code quality is monitored through [codacity](https://www.codacy.com/app/Sylhare/nprime/dashboard).
For the tests coverage, there's [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Sylhare/nprime) which is run during the [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Sylhare/nprime) pipeline.

## Math

Here are a bit of information to help understand some of the algorithms

### Congruence

 "`≡`" means congruent, `a ≡ b (mod m)` implies that 
`m / (a-b), ∃ k ∈ Z` that verifies `a = kn + b`
   
 which implies:

    a ≡ 0 (mod n) <-> a = kn <-> "a" is divisible by "n" 
    
### Strong Pseudoprime

A strong [pseudoprime](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongPseudoprime.html) to a base `a` is an odd composite number `n` 
with `n-1 = d·2^s` (for d odd) for which either `a^d = 1(mod n)` or `a^(d·2^r) = -1(mod n)` for some `r = 0, 1, ..., s-1` </br>
    
### Erathostene's Sieve

This sieve mark as composite the multiple of each primes. It is an efficient way to find primes.
For `n ∈ N` with `n > 2` and for `∀ a ∈[2, ..., √n]` then `n/a ∉ N` is true.

### Fermat's Theorem

If `n` is prime then `∀ a ∈[1, ..., n-1]`

```
    a^(n-1) ≡ 1 (mod n) ⇔ a^(n-1) = kn + 1
```
   
### Miller rabin

For `n ∈ N` and `n > 2`, </br>
Take a random `a ∈ {1,...,n−1}` </br>
Find `d` and `s` such as with `n - 1 = 2^s * d` (with d odd) </br>
if `(a^d)^2^r ≡ 1 mod n` for all `r` in `0` to `s-1` </br>
Then `n` is prime.

The test output is false of 1/4 of the "a values" possible in `n`, 
so the test is repeated t times.
