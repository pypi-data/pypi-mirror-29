Docker Remote
=============

   :alt: 

Remote is a tool for managing Docker applications via
`Compose <https://github.com/docker/compose>`__ on another machine. It
uses SSH tunnels to connect your Docker and Docker Compose client with
your Docker Host. It is useful as an alternative to
`Machine <https://docs.docker.com/machine/>`__ or to deploy an app on a
server without manually loggin in via SSH.

::

    $ docker-remote shell
    Setting up a docker-compose alias...

    $ alias && echo $DOCKER_HOST
    alias docker-compose='docker-remote compose'
    tcp://localhost:2375
    $ cat docker-compose.yml
    version: '3.4'
    services:
      web:
        image: nginx
    x-docker-remote:
      project:
        name: myapp

    $ docker-compose up --build --detach
    $ docker ps

Check out the `Documentation <docs/>`__ for installation instructions
and tutorials.

-  Pre-processes your Docker Compose configuration in order to place all
   named and relative volume names inside a project directory.

   ``/etc/hosts`` for all or selected services
