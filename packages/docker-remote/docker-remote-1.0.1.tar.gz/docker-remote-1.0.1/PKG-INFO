Description: Docker Remote
        =============

        Remote is a tool for managing Docker applications via
        `Compose <https://github.com/docker/compose>`__ on another machine. It
        uses SSH tunnels to connect your Docker and Docker Compose client with
        your Docker Host. It is useful as an alternative to
        `Machine <https://docs.docker.com/machine/>`__ or to deploy an app on a
        server without manually loggin in via SSH.
        
        ::
        
            $ docker-remote shell
            Setting up a docker-compose alias...
        
            $ alias && echo $DOCKER_HOST
            alias docker-compose='docker-remote compose'
            tcp://localhost:2375
            $ cat docker-compose.yml
            version: '3.4'
            services:
              web:
                image: nginx
            x-docker-remote:
              project:
                name: myapp
        
            $ docker-compose up --build --detach
            $ docker ps
        
        Check out the `Documentation <docs/>`__ for installation instructions
        and tutorials.
        
        **Features**
        
        -  Allows you to compose and manage applications remotely
        -  Pre-processes your Docker Compose configuration in order to place all
           named and relative volume names inside a project directory.
        -  Ability to automatically add a ``dockerhost`` hostname to
           ``/etc/hosts`` for all or selected services
