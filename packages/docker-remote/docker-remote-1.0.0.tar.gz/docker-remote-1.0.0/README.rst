Docker Remote
=============

|image0| *Note: This is work in progress software.*

Remote is a tool for managing Docker applications via
`Compose <https://github.com/docker/compose>`__ on another machine. It
uses SSH tunnels to connect your Docker and Docker Compose client with
your Docker Host.

::

    $ docker-remote shell
    Setting up a docker-compose alias...

    $ alias && echo $DOCKER_HOST
    alias docker-compose='docker-remote compose'
    tcp://localhost:2375
    $ cat docker-compose.yml
    version: '3.4'
    services:
      web:
        image: nginx
    x-docker-remote:
      project:
        name: myapp

    $ docker-compose up --build --detach
    $ docker ps

Check out the `Documentation <docs/>`__ for installation instructions
and tutorials.
