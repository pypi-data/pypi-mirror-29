- [ ] Add python interface for permanently changing default compilation options.

- [ ] Make intermediate fortran subroutine that passes assumed
      shapes back into C (for passing subroutines as arguments when 
      the subroutines have assumed shape arrays).

- [ ] Add support for fortran data types (structs in C).

- [ ] Add scanner that automatically parses the first few lines of
      python file that imported fmodpy to do automatic compilation.
