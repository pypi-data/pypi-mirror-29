- [ ] Make sure fortran argument names do not conflict with reserved
      words in python, if they do, then add a reserved-word prefix

- [ ] Modules that may be needed are not compiled before the size
      testing program is compiled and executed. This causes crash.

- [ ] If multiple files containing same-named subroutines exist in the
      source fortran file directory then the autocompile_extra_files
      option will cause multiple-declaration linking errors.
