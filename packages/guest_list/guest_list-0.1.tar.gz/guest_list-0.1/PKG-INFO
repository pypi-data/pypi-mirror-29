            {"latitude": 53.3381985, 'longitude': -6.2592576}

            guests = guest_list.create("customers.json")
        
            for guest in guests:

            max_distance_km = 60.0  
        
            guests = guest_list.create("customers.json", office_coordinates=office_coordinates, max_distance_km=max_distance_km)
        
            for guest in guests:
