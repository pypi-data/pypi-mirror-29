        Mezzanine is a content management platform built using the Django
        framework. It is BSD licensed and designed to provide both a
        consistent interface for managing content, and a simple, extensible
        architecture that makes diving in and hacking on the code as easy as
        possible.

        people have built using Mezzanine.

        This Fork
        ===========
        
        This fork borrows heavily from the original project https://github.com/dfalk/mezzanine-wiki.
        Essentially the only changes are: updating the views to Class based, removing South
        as the db and tweaking the urls.
        
        ===========
        Quick start
        ===========
        
        1. Activate your virtualenv (if applicable). Install mezzanine-wiki with "pip install mezzanine-wiki":
        
        2. Add "mezzanine_wiki" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'mezzanine_wiki',
            )
            
        3. Add "mezzanine_wiki.WikiPage" to SEARCH_MODEL_CHOICES in your app's settings like this:
        
           SEARCH_MODEL_CHOICES = ('pages.Page', 'blog.BlogPost', 'mezzanine_wiki.WikiPage')
        
        4. Include the wiki URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
           url(r'^wiki/', include('mezzanine_wiki.urls')),
        
        5. To use the RTF editor add the following to your app's settings:
        
           WIKI_TEXT_WIDGET_CLASS = 'mezzanine.core.forms.TinyMceWidget'
        
        6. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the wiki models.
        
        7. Restart server.
        
        8. Visit /wiki/ to use the wiki.
