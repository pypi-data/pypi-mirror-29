        yeelightsunflower is a Python package for interacting with Yeelight Sunflower light bulbs.
        
        Product details for these bulbs can be found at the following website (but note that they may not be available any more): https://www.yeelight.com/en_US/product/yeelight-sunflower
        
        This library was written primarily to work with Home Assistant: https://home-assistant.io
        
        Communication is via TCP commands, e.g.  
        Sending `GL,,,,0,\r\n` to the IP address of the Yeelight hub gets the current state of all lights and would return something like: `GLB 143E,1,1,22,255,10,10,0,0;287B,1,1,64,255,10,10,0,0;0001,1,1,0,255,10,10,0,0;`  
        Sending `C 143F,255,0,255,50,\r\n` would set the light identified by `143F` to magenta at 50% brightness.  
        
        The library wraps these commands in a form suitable as a platform for the Home Assistant light component, and could be used by other modules.  
         
        This library does not implement the SSDP hub identification that Yeelight Sunflower hubs support.

        ===============================
        
        0.0.9 (2018-03-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Handle and log invalid responses when getting lights (avoid IndexError)
                
        
        0.0.8 (2017-02-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Correct problem with CHANGELOG missing in PyPi package (update MANIFEST.in) 
        
        
        0.0.7 (2017-02-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Try to reconnect socket when there's a send/receive error 
        - Set availability of lights to False if hub is unavailable
        
        
        0.0.6 (2017-02-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Add time check to use cached data instead of fetching new data via TCP. This is useful since multiple bulb objects will get the hub's data in short succession, and all should just use the same values.
        
        0.0.5 (2017-02-17)
        ------------------
        - Make library thread safe with threading.Lock
