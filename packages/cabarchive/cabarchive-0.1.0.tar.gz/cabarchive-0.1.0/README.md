# python-cabarchive

If you want to parse Microsoft Cabinet files in Python you probably
should just install gcab, and use the GObjectIntrospection bindings
for that. GCab is a much better library than this and handles many more
kinds of archive.

If GCab is not available to you (e.g. you're trying to run in an
OpenShift instance on RHEL 6.2), this project might be somewhat useful.

Contributors welcome, either adding new functionality or fixing bugs.
