    This is a configuration optimization which will become the default in OSP11. In case you need to shrink the DB, this then can be done without a backup restore of all databases with this option using the 'optimize table' mysql command. 
    Therefore no downtime is then needed. But just setting the option in the config will not migrate the databases. They'd need to be recreated.
    Without it, in order to reduce database size (and of ibdata file) can only done via full backup, removal of database and restore from backup.
