Description: Redis-Tryton
        ============
        
        Redis Cache backend for the Tryton application framework.
        
        
        In order to configure the redis cache you should modify your trytond
        configuration file to include the redis_tryton.RedisCache as class of the
        cache section. Optionally you can especify the redis uri with the uri value.
        If you do not specify the uri value it will use `redis:/127.0.0.1:6379/0` as
        default value. An example configuration file looks like::
        
            [cache]
            class=redis_tryton.RedisCache
            uri=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
        
        Once you have specified the config file, everything should work out of the
        box and you should see your cache values created on the redis database.
        
        It uses msgpack as an eficient way to dump python objects to the redis cache.
