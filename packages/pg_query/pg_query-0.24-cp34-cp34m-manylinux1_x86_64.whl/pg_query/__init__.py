    When `safety_belt` is ``True``, the resulting statement is parsed again and its *AST*
    compared with the original statement: if they don't match, a warning is emitted and the
    original statement is returned. This is a transient protection against possible bugs in the
    serialization machinery that may disappear before 1.0.
