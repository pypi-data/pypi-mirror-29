This file includes functions used for the preprocessing of measurement data that is to be analyzed using bayesloop. The
time series data is formatted into data segments that can be fed to the inference algorithm piece-by-piece.

Example: The auto-regressive process of first order needs two subsequent data points at each time step. Therefore, the
    data is separated into overlapping data segments containing two data points.
