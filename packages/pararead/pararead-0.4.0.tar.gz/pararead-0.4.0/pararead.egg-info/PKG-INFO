Description: Pararead: parallel processing of sequencing reads
        =================================================
        
        Pararead is a python package that simplifies parallel processing of DNA
        sequencing reads (BAM or SAM files), by parallelizing across
        chromosomes. Pararead is build for developers of python scripts that
        process data read-by-read. It enables you to quickly and easily
        parallelize your script.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ``pararead`` is hosted on pypi. Install with:
        
        ::
        
            pip install --user pararead
        
        Or, within active environment:
        
        ::
        
            pip install --upgrade pararead
        
        Developing tools that use pararead
        ----------------------------------
        
        The main model provided is an abstract class
        called\ ``ParaReadProcessor``, for which concrete children are created
        by implementing a ``__call__`` method. This creates a callable instance
        that is then mapped over chromosomes.
        
        The concept is generally described in this early `blog
        post <http://databio.org/posts/tabix_files.html>`__, which initiated the
        project that eventually became ``pararead``. More details will be
        forthcoming.
