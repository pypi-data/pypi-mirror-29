    Notes
    -----

    When modelling adsorption in micropores, a requirement was highlighted by
    Jensen and Seaton in 1996 [#]_, that at sufficiently high pressures the adsorption
    isotherm should not reach a horizontal plateau corresponding to saturation but
    that this asymptote should continue to rise due to the compression of the adsorbate
    in the pores. They came up with a semi-empirical equation to describe this phenomenon
    based on a function that interpolates between two asymptotes: the Henry’s law asymptote
    at low pressure and an asymptote reflecting the compressibility of the adsorbate at
    high pressure.

    Here :math:`K_H` is the Henry constant, :math:`b` is the compressibility of the
    adsorbed phase and :math:`c` an empirical constant.

    The equation can be used to model both absolute and excess adsorption as the pore
    volume can be incorporated into the definition of :math:`b`, although this can lead
    to negative adsorption slopes for the compressibility asymptote.
    This equation has been found to provide a better fit for experimental data
    from microporous solids than the Langmuir or Toth equation, in particular for
    adsorbent/adsorbate systems with high Henry’s constants where the amount adsorbed
    increases rapidly at relatively low pressures and then slows down dramatically.
