Description: # Scraping song lyrics from Genius.com
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/johnwmillr/GeniusLyrics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johnwmillr/GeniusLyrics)
        
        ## Setup
        This repository is intended to provide an easy interface for programatically accessing the song information stored on [Genius.com](https://www.genius.com). Check out [my blog post](http://www.johnwmillr.com/scraping-genius-lyrics/) for a more thorough description of the package and its usage.
        
        Start by cloning this repo:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius.git
        ```
        
        To use the Genius API you'll need to sign up for a (free) client that authorizes you to [access their API](http://genius.com/api-clients). You'll need to supply the `client_access_token` that Genius gives you when using this module. See [Usage](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius#usage) below for an example.
        
        You can read through the [Genius API docs](https://docs.genius.com/), but I've found it more helpful to start by looking at code folks have already written for the API. I found [this post](https://bigishdata.com/2016/09/27/getting-song-lyrics-from-geniuss-api-scraping) from @jackschultz and [this repository](https://github.com/jasonqng/genius-lyrics-search) from @JasonQNg real helpful while getting started, check their work out.  
        
        ## Installation
        1. Clone this repo:  
        `git clone https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius.git`
        2. Enter the directory created:  
        `cd LyricsGenius`
        3. Install using pip:  
        `pip install .`
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        >>> import lyricsgenius as genius
        >>> api = genius.Genius('my_client_access_token_here')
        >>> artist = api.search_artist('Andy Shauf', max_songs=3)
        Searching for Andy Shauf...
        
        Song 1: "Alexander All Alone"
        Song 2: "Begin Again"
        Song 3: "Comfortable With Silence"
        
        Reached user-specified song limit (3).
        Found 3 songs.
        
        Done.
        >>> print(artist)
        Andy Shauf, 3 songs
        >>> song = api.search_song('To You',artist.name)
        Searching for "To You" by Andy Shauf...
        Done.
        >>> print(song)
        "To You" by Andy Shauf:

        >>> artist.add_song(song)
        >>> print(artist)
        Andy Shauf, 4 songs
        ```
        
        You can also call the package from the command line.
        ```
        $python -m lyricsgenius --search_song 'Begin Again' 'Andy Shauf'
        $python -m lyricsgenius --search_artist 'Lupe Fiasco' 3
        ```
