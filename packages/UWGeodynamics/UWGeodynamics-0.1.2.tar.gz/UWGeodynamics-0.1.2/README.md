Underworld Geodynamics project
==============================

The UWGeodynamics module intents to facilitate rapid prototyping of geodynamics models using Underworld. 
It can be seen as a set of high-level functions within the Underworld ecosystem. 
It is a means to quickly get the user into Underworld modelling and assumes very
little knowledge in coding. The module make some assumptions based on how the user
defines the boundary conditions and the properties of the materials (rocks, phases).
Its simplicity comes with a relatively more rigid workflow (compared to the classic Underworld functions).
However, the user can easily break the high level objects and get back to core
Underworld function at any step of model design.

As we think the low-level interface is more flexible, and in so allows for more complex models,
we strongly encourage users to explore and break the High Level functions.

We hope that the user will naturally move to the low-level functionalities as he
or her gets more confident, and by doing so will access the wide range of 
possibilities offered by Underworld.
