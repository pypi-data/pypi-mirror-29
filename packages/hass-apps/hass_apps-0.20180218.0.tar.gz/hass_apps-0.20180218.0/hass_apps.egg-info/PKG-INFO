        =========
        
        Some useful apps and snippets to empower Home Assistant and AppDaemon
        even more.
        
        
        Apps
        ----
        
        All apps for AppDaemon can be found inside the ``hass_apps`` directory
        of this repository. Each includes a sample configuration in the file
        ``doc/apps.yaml.example``.
        
        Currently, the following apps are included:
        
        * `heaty`_:  A highly-configurable, comfortable to use Home Assistant /
          appdaemon app that controls thermostats based on a schedule while still
          facilitating manual intervention at any time.
        * **motion_light**:  This app can turn devices on/off according to the
          state of sensors.
          The most obvious use case is controlling lights when motion sensors
          report motion, but other scenarios are imaginable as well. Delays and
          constraints can be configured freely for each individual sensor.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        In order to use one or more of the apps provided here, please install
        the whole ``hass_apps`` package. Don't worry, only the apps you configure
        will be loaded.
        
        Install from PyPi:
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install hass_apps
        
        Or clone the GitHub repository to get even the latest changes:
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/efficiosoft/hass_apps
            cd hass_apps
            pip3 install . --upgrade
        
        
        A note for hass.io users
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        As far as I know, it's not possible to create a plug & play add-on for
        hass.io containing hass-apps, because it needs to be installed into
        AppDaemon's container.
        
        Even though it's untested, the only actions needed in order to install
        under hass.io should be:
        
        1. Install the appdaemon add-on.
        2. Copy the ``hass_apps`` folder and the file
           ``hass_apps/data/hass_apps_loader.py`` into the ``apps`` directory of
           your AppDaemon container. This is also the only thing you need to do
           when upgrading to a newer version of hass-apps.
        3. Continue with the configuration as normal.
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        1. Get yourself a nice cup of coffee or tea. You'll surely need it.
        2. Copy the file ``hass_apps/data/hass_apps_loader.py`` into your
           AppDaemon's ``apps`` directory. This is just a stub which imports
           the real app's code.
        3. Pick one or more apps you want to use.
        4. Copy the contents of ``hass_apps/some_app/doc/apps.yaml.example``
           to your ``apps.yaml`` file and adapt it as necessary. The example
           files also contain documentation comments explaining what the
           different settings mean.
        5. AppDaemon should have noticed the changes made to ``apps.yaml`` and
           restart its apps automatically.
        
        You're done!
        
        
        Upgrade
        -------
        
        Simply pull upgrades from PyPi:
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install --upgrade hass_apps
        
        Or, if you installed from the git repository:
        
        ::
        
            cd /path/to/your/clone/of/the/repository
            git pull
            pip3 install . --upgrade
        
        Note that AppDaemon doesn't detect changes in the imported modules
        automatically and needs to be restarted manually after an upgrade.
        
        
        Roadmap
        -------
        
        Currently, the following enhancements are planned.
        
        * [General] Restructure docs and move them to readthedocs.org.
        * [Heaty] Restructure core parts to make maintaining easier.
        
        
        Donations
        ---------
        
        I work on this project in my spare time, as most free software developers
        do. And of course, I enjoy this work a lot. There is no and will never be
        a need to pay anything for using my software.
        
        However, if you want to donate me a cup of coffee, a beer in the evening,
        my monthly hosting fees or anything else embellishing my day a little
        more, that would be awesome. If you decide doing so, I want to thank you
        very much! But please be assured that I'm not presuming anybody to donate,
        it's entirely your choice.
