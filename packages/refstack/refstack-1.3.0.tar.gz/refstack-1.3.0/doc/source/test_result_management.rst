Test result management
======================

Test result to product version association
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test results uploaded by users can be associated to a version of a product. To
perform this association, the user must be both the one who uploaded the result
and also an admin of the vendor which owns the product. Once a test result is
associated to a product, all admins of the vendor which owns the product can
manage the test result.

Mark or unmark a test results as verified
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Foundation admins can mark and un-mark a test as verified.  A verified
test result can not be updated or deleted.
