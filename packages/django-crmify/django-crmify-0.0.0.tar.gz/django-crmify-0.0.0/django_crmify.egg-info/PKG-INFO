Description: # django-crmify
        A django app for quickly integrating a full-featured 3rd party CRM into an application
        
        ## Purpose
        To begin, the purpose of crmify is **NOT** to be a full featured CRM. It's utility is as a bridge between a Django application
        and a 3rd party CRM. 
        
        ## Example Workflows
        For the examples below, assume our setup is with the Insightly CRM.
         
        *Basic Lead Management*
        1. User comes to site and registers for account, this triggers a crmify event to create a lead in Insightly
        2. User unregisters account, this sets the lead status to the value of `settings.BACKEND_OPTIONS.LEAD_DEAD_STATUS`
        
        *Basic Sales Funnel*
        1. User comes to site and registers, triggers crmify to create a lead
        2. User makes a purchase, this sets the lead status to the value of `settings.BACKEND_OPTIONS.LEAD_CONVERTED_STATUS`
