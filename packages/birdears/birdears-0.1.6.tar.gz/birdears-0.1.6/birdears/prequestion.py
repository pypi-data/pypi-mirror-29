"""This module implements pre-questions' progressions.

Pre questions are chord progressions or notes played before the question is
played, so to affirmate the sound of the question's key.

For example a common cadence is chords I-IV-V-I from the diatonic scale, which
in a key of `C` is `CM-FM-GM-CM` and in a key of `A` is `AM-DM-EM-AM`.

Pre-question methods should be decorated with `register_prequestion_method`
decorator, so that they will be registered as a valid pre-question method.
