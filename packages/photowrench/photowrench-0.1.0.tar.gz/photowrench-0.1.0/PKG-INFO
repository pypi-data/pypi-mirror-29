        ===========
        
        Just a small tool to perform photography related tasks that are
        kind of annoying. So far following commands are implemented:
        
        - ``remove-orphan-raws``: removes raw files that do not match any picture file (e.g. .jpeg)
        - ``rename-to-timestamp``:  Renames files to their timestamp
        
        Type anytime ``photowrench -h`` to see commands and options.

        This is in PyPI, so just run::
