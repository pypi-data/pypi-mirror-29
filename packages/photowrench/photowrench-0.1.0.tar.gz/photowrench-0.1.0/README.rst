photowrench
===========

Just a small tool to perform photography related tasks that are
kind of annoying. So far following commands are implemented:

- ``remove-orphan-raws``: removes raw files that do not match any picture file (e.g. .jpeg)
- ``rename-to-timestamp``:  Renames files to their timestamp

Type anytime ``photowrench -h`` to see commands and options.

Instalation
-----------

This is in PyPI, so just run::

    pip install photowrench
