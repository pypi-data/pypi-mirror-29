Description: # Pics2Word
        
        A command line program to copy pictures into a word document.
        
        Usage can be found using
        
        `$ pics2word -h help`
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installing the Pics2Word software:
        
        1. Install Python (Latest version of 3.X series, NOT 2.7). This is a dependency that is required for the program to work and allows us to install pics2word with pip. (Pip is a recursive acronym for pip installs packages)
        
        2. When that is installed, open the command line (or PowerShell) and then type:
        
            `$ pip install pics2word`
        
            This installs the latest version of pics2word onto the system.
        
            From the latest Windows 10 update, the PowerShell can be opened from windows file explorer > File > Open Windows PowerShell
            From Linux you may need root privillages. If the above does not work, try
        
            `$ sudo pip install pics2word --user`
        
        3. You can now run “pics2word” from the command line anywhere. Type:
        
            `$ pics2word –h help`
        
            for information on how to use it.
        
        Note: pics2word can be updated to the latest release with:
        
        `$ pip install --upgrade pics2word`
        
        note the two dashes before upgrade.
        
        Useful supplementary third party software:
        
        - [Caesium](https://saerasoft.com/caesium/) – image compression software. Useful if dealing with a large number of pictures to reduce the file size of the word document and speed up image processing.
        - [Bulk Rename Utility](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php) – allows large numbers of files to be renamed automatically. Especially useful if following a format such as “Photo 1, Photo 2... Photo X”
        
        ## New to this release 0.9.2
        
        - Picture files are now sorted more intellegently by picking integers from strings then ordering by number.
