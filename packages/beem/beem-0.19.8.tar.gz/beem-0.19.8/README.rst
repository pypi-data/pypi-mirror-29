beem - Unofficial Python Library for Steem
===============================================

!!!Alpha-State, be carefull!!!

beem is an unofficial python library for steem, which is created new from scratch from `python-bitshares`_
The library name is derived from a beam maschine, similar to the analogy between steem and steam. beem includes `python-graphenelib`_.

beem can be installed parallel to python-steem.

For Debian and Ubuntu, please ensure that the following packages are installed:
        
.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev python-dev

You can install beem from this repository if you want the latest
but possibly non-compiling version::

    git clone https://github.com/holgern/beem.git
    cd beem
    python setup.py build
    
    python setup.py install --user

Installing beem with conda-forge
--------------------------------

Installing beem from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    
Once the conda-forge channel has been enabled, beem can be installed with:

    conda install beem
