        ===========
        What you see here is a post-0.3.6 Git version of ``gevent-socketio``
        maintained by `Sebastian Pipping <https://github.com/hartwork>`_ (``@hartwork``)
        branded ``gevent-socketio-hartwork`` for distinction on PyPI.
        
        The idea is to deviate from upstream ``gevent-socketio`` as little as possible
        and mirror branch ``master`` unmodified.  Maintenance is done on
        `branch hartwork-master <https://github.com/hartwork/gevent-socketio/commits/hartwork-master>`_.
        
        Over release 0.3.6, these notable commits are included, from most recent to oldest:

        Presentation
        ============
        
        .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/hartwork/gevent-socketio.png?branch=master
        
        ``gevent-socketio`` is a Python implementation of the Socket.IO
        protocol, developed originally for Node.js by LearnBoost and then
        ported to other languages.  Socket.IO enables real-time web
        communications between a browser and a server, using a WebSocket-like
        API.  One aim of this project is to provide a single ``gevent``-based
        API that works across the different WSGI-based web frameworks out
        there (Pyramid, Pylons, Flask, web2py, Django, etc...).  Only ~3 lines
        of code are required to tie-in ``gevent-socketio`` in your framework.
        Note: you need to use the ``gevent`` python WSGI server to use
        ``gevent-socketio``.
        
        Community, rise up!
        ===================
        
        ANNOUNCEMENT: This project is in need of a solid maintainer to navigate through the 27+ open Pull Requests, merge what needs to be merged, and continue on with newer developments. @abourget is not putting as much time as he'd like on this project these days.  This project has nearly 1000 GitHub Stars.. it's used by major corporations. It's a great project for you to lead. Contact @abourget on Twitter @bourgetalexndre to take more leadership.
        
        
        Technical overview
        ==================
        
        Most of the ``gevent-socketio`` implementation is pure Python.  There
        is an obvious dependency on ``gevent``, and another on
        ``gevent-websocket``.  There are integration examples for Pyramid, Flask,
        Django and BYOF (bring your own framework!).

        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install with standard Python methods::
        
           pip install gevent-socketio-hartwork
        
        or from source::
        
           git clone git://github.com/hartwork/gevent-socketio.git
           cd gevent-socketio
           python setup.py install
        
        For development, run instead of ``install``::
        
           python setup.py develop
        
        If you want to do all of that in a virtualenv, run::
        
           virtualenv env
           . env/bin/activate
           python setup.py develop   # or install
        
        To execute all tests, run:
        
            tox
        
        To execute all tests for a specific Python version, run something like:
        
            tox -e py27
            
        To execute a specific test for a specific Python version, run something like:
        
            tox -e py27 -- test_packet.py::TestEncodeMessage::test_encode_event
