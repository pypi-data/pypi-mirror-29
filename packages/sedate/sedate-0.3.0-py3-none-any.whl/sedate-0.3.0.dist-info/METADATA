There are projects like `Arrow <https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow>`_ or
`Delorean <https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow>`_ which provide ways to work
with timezones without having to think about it too much.

Seantis doesn't use them because we *want* to reason about these things,
to ensure they are correct, and partly because of self-loathing.

Adding another layer makes this reasoning harder.
