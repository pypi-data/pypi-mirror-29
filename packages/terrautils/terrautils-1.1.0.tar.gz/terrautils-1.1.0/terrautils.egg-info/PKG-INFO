Description: 
        This package provides standard functions for interacting
        with TERRA-REF services and data. The primary intended users of the package
        are authors of data processing automation tools known as Clowder extractors
        but others working with TERRA-REF data may find it useful.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way install terrautils is using pip and pulling from PyPI.::
        
            pip install terrautils
        
        Because this system is still under rapid development, you may need a 
        specific branch from the terrautils repository. You can either clone 
        the repository from GitHub and install locally with following commands::
        
            git clone https://github.com/terraref/terrautils
            git checkout <branch>
            cd terrautils
            pip install .
        
        Or you can install directly from GitHub with a single command::
        
            pip install https://github.com/terraref/terrautils/archive/<branch>.zip
        
        **Note:** the terrautils package is heavily dependent on the GDAL library 
        and tools. Installing GDAL can most easily be accomplished at the 
        operating system level using packages designed for your distribution.  If 
        you see errors about failing to import osgeo you need to make ensure GDAL
        and its python wrappers are installed. Terrautils will work with both GDAL
        v1.11 and v2.2 so whichever is available for your system should be fine.
