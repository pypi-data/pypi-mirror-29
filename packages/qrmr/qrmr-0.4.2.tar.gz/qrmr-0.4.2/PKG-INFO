Description: QRMR, AWS terminal login tool
        =============================================
        
            Work secure using MFA according to best practices, and efficiently
            with AWS terminal tools like ``aws`` cli, ``aws-shell``,
            ``terraform``, etc.
        
        Highly opinionated Amazon Web Services (AWS) terminal login toolkit, focused on
        enforcing and simplifying AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
        
        Written in Python 3, backwards compatible with Python 2, thanks to ``futures``!
        
        Currently being heavily tested in production against AWS multi-account setup (Well-Architected Framework) on macOS High Sierra.
        
        Feels most at home using `virtualenv`, of course.
        
        **How it works:**
        
        * Stores your AWS IAM credential profile in ``~/.qrmr/credentials.ini``;
        * Prompts for MFA OTP code;
        * Uses AWS STS to retrieve and store fresh SessionToken and temporary Access Key ID and Secret Access Key using your credential profile.
        
        **Near future:**
        
        * Manage ``~/.aws/credentials`` and ``~/.aws/config`` files
        * Unit Tests :)
        
        Because you probably just want to start using it:
        
        **Installation of QRMR:**
        
        ``pip install qrmr``
        
        **Setup of AWS Credentials:**
        
        ``qrmr setup``
        
        **Refreshing your SessionToken and temporary keys:**
        
        ``qrmr refresh``
        
        **Be cool:**
        
        ``aws s3 ls``
        
        
        **REMEMBER:** set environment variable AWS_PROFILE in your shell or virtualenv to
        make life easier:
        
        ``export AWS_PROFILE=iam_user_name``
