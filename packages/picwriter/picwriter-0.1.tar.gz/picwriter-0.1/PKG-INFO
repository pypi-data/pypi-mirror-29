        # PICwriter README
        Picwriter (Photonic-Integrated-Circuit Writer) is a Python module, built above the [gdspy](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy) module, aimed at simplifying the process of designing complex masks for photonic integrated circuits through a prebuilt library of easy-to-implement PCells (technically all sub-classes of the gdspy Cell class).  Supported blocks currently include: waveguides, straight grating couplers, focusing grating couplers, tapers, spiral structures, 1x2 multi-mode interferometers.  2x2 Multi-mode interferometers (MMI's), resonators, and more are coming soon!
        
        ## Features
        The ultimate goal of this module is to reduce the time required to generate photonic integrated circuit mask designs, by extending the functionality of the gdspy library.
        * High-level specification of common building blocks for photonic-integrated circuits
        * Fabrication specific masks.  Specify the photoresist type (`'+'` or `'-'`) and fabrication type (such as `'ETCH'`) and PICwriter will generate the appropriate mask files for electron-beam or photolithography.
        * All library components are subclasses of the gdspy Cell class, so gdspy Cell features such as `rotation()`, `copy()`, `flatten()`, `get_bounding_box()`, etc. are all supported.
        * Unique cell identifiers.  Add components to your mask layout without worrying about name-clashes.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Dependencies:
        With a working version of python, all dependencies should be automatically installed through the instructions below.
        
        * [Python](http://www.python.org/) (tested with versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 for Linux/OS, tested with versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 2.7-x64, 3.4-x64, 3.5-x64, 3.6-x64 for Windows.)
        * [gdspy](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy) (tested with versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6)
        * [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
        * [UUID](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uuid/)
        * [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
        * [Python-future](http://python-future.org/) (only for Python 2)
        
        ### Linux / OS X
        Both options should automatically install all dependencies (like gdspy, numpy, etc.).  This module is in the early planning stage, so stay tuned for the actual release :)
        
        Option 1: using [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/) (coming soon):
        
        ```sh
        pip install picwriter
        ```
        
        Option 2: download the source from [github](https://github.com/DerekK88/picwriter) and build/install with:
        
        ```sh
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Windows
        The best way of obtaining the library is by installing the prebuilt binaries.
        * First, download gdspy by going [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/heitzmann/gdspy), then click the python environment that matches your python environment, click the **Artifacts** tab, and then download the corresponding `dist\gdspy-1.X.X.X.whl` wheel file.
        * Open up a command prompt (type `cmd` in the search bar), navigate to your downloads, then install via:
        ```sh
        pip install dist\gdspy-1.X.X.X.whl
        ```
        * Next, install the PICwriter library by following the same procedure [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DerekK88/picwriter) to install the corresponding prebuilt picwriter `.whl` file.
        * In a command prompt, install with pip
        ```sh
        pip install dist\picwriter-1.X.X.X.whl
        ```
        Building from source is also possible.  For installing gdspy, an appropriate [build environment](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) is required for compilation of the C extension modules.
