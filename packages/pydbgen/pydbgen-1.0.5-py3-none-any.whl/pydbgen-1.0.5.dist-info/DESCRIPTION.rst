This Python package generates a random database ``TABLE`` (or a Pandas dataframe, or an Excel file) based on user's choice of data types (database fields). User can specify the number of samples needed. One can also designate a **PRIMARY KEY** for the database table. Finally, the ``TABLE`` is inserted into a new or existing database file of user's choice.
