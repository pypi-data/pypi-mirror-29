librecaptcha
============

Version 0.3.3

librecaptcha is a free/libre program and library that allows you to solve
`reCAPTCHA`_ challenges.

*This does not automatically solve challenges. It provides an interface through
which a human can solve them.*

Usage
-----

If you installed librecaptcha, you can simply run ``librecaptcha``.
Otherwise, run ``./librecaptcha.py``. This will show usage information.

To use librecaptcha programmatically, import it::

    from librecaptcha import get_token

and then call the ``get_token()`` function. Its signature is::

    get_token(api_key, site_url, debug=False, user_agent=None)

Parameters:

* ``api_key`` (str): The reCAPTCHA API key to use.
* ``site_url`` (str): The base URL of the site that contains the reCAPTCHA
  challenge. This should start with ``http://`` or ``https://`` and include the
  hostname, but nothing else. For example, ``https://example.com``.
* ``debug`` (bool): Whether or not to print debug information.
* ``user_agent`` (str): The user-agent string to use. If not specified, a
  random one will be used.

Returns (str): A reCAPTCHA token. This should usually be submitted with the
form as the value of the ``g-recaptcha-response`` field. (Note: These tokens
usually expire after a couple of minutes.)
