Errors shown when a ``pytest.raises()`` with ``match=`` fails are now cleaner on what happened: When no exception was raised, the "matching '...'" part got removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn't match. When a wrong exception was raised, it's now thrown (like ``pytest.raised()`` without ``match=`` would) instead of complaining about the unmatched text.
