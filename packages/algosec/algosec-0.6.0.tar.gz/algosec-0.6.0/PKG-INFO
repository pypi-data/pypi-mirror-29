        =======
        
        A Python SDK providing simple access to AlgoSec APIs, including handy methods
        to implement common network security policy management tasks, such as:
        
        * Check whether specific traffic is allowed by the firewalls and security devices in the network.
        * Open a network security change request.
        * Check status of existing change requests.
        * Update business application connectivity requirements (and automatically trigger change requests as needed)
        
        Useful for automation and orchestration (e.g. DevOps), building custom portals, or exposing specific functionality to Application Owners, IT, Helpdesk, Information Security, Security Operations, etc.
        
        Included in this package are clients for AlgoSec Firewall Analyzer, FireFlow and BusinessFlow.
