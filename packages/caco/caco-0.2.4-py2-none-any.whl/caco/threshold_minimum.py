def threshold_minimum(image, nbins=1e4, max_iter=1000):
    """Return threshold value based on minimum method.
    The histogram of the input `image` is computed and smoothed until there are
    only two maxima. Then the minimum in between is the threshold value.
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : (M, N) ndarray
        Input image.
    nbins : int, optional
        Number of bins used to calculate histogram. This value is ignored for
        integer arrays.
    max_iter: int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations to smooth the histogram.
    Returns
    -------
    threshold : float
        Upper threshold value. All pixels with an intensity higher than
        this value are assumed to be foreground.
    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If unable to find two local maxima in the histogram or if the
        smoothing takes more than 1e4 iterations.
