# s3bro! A handy s3 cli tool
s3bro?
---
It's your s3 friend (bro). Often you'll need to run complex CLI/AWS commands in order to execute tasks against S3.  Let's say you need to restore all your keys from S3 Glacier storage class, we know (probably) that AWS CLI does not provide an easy way to run this in "batch". So you would need mix aws cli and pipe it to additional commands. Additionally, it would restore key by key, very slowly.
The s3bro do it for you nicely, and using multiprocessing/threading. That means that you could get it done way faster than using the normal method. Oh, also in an elegant way.

This is a python cli that will abstract a big portion of this work for you.
> Why would you run the two following commands to wipe your bucket:
```
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket rsavordelli --output json --query
    'Versions\[\].\[Key, VersionId\]' | jq -r '.\[\] | "--key '\\''" + .\[0\] + "'\\''
         --version-id " + .\[1\]' |  xargs -L1 aws s3api delete-object --bucket rsavordelli
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket rsavordelli --output json --query
     'DeleteMarkers\[\].\[Key, VersionId\]' | jq -r '.\[\] | "--key '\\''" + .\[0\] + "'\\''
         --version-id " + .\[1\]' |  xargs -L1 aws s3api delete-object --bucket rsavordelli
```
> when you could run:
```
s3bro purge --bucket rsavordelli
```
> what if you need to restore all your keys from glacier storage class? Or just some of them?

 - --days - (integer) - how many days you want to keep the s3 keys restored
 - --type - The type of glacier restore (check aws docs as it has cost implications)
 - --prefix (string) - filter the content that will be restored (similar to aws cli)
 - --include (string) - only restore keys that match with the string passed. Note: You can pass --include multiple times to specify
   different patterns
 - --exclude (string) - skip keys that match with the pattern passed through it. You can also give multiple inputs by repeating --exclude
 - --workers (integer) - how many workers to spawn to help with the restoring process
 - --versions (None) - if passed, it will include all versions (current and non-current versions)
 - --update-restore-date (None) - if passed, it will check for already restored keys and update the restore expiration. It will "extend" the

## purge

 Delete all keys within a bucket - as simple as that (versions, delete markers, everything)

  --help         Show this message and exit.
  --log-level <INFO|DEBUG|ERROR|WARNING> [default ERROR]

### Details
