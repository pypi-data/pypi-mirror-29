Description: PSLS: the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator
        
        Simulate solar-like oscillators representative for PLATO observations.
        The simulator includes planetary transits, stochastically-excited oscillations, granulation and activity background components, as well as instrumental sources of noise representative for PLATO. The program also manages the existence of a time shift between groups of telescope.
        Planetary transits are included following Mandel & Agol (2002) equations (see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...580L.171M) and using the Python implementation by Ian Crossfield (http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ianc/) at UCLA.

        Changes history:
        - 0.6: minor problems fixed (missing file,  link problem)
        - 0.5: can perform simulation for a given input set of theoretical frequencies (i.e. from a given .gsm file) ; new parameters included in the configuration file .yaml ; various minor improvements
        - 0.4: minor changes
        - 0.3: first working version
