Chemfiles is a library for reading and writing molecular
trajectory files. These files are created by your favorite theoretical chemistry
program, and contains informations about atomic or residues names and positions.
Chemfiles offers abstraction on top of these formats, and a consistent interface
for loading and saving data to these files.
