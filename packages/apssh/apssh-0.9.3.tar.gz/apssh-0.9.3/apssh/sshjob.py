    Similar to the :py:obj:`apssh.sshproxy.SshProxy`; the differences

    * `username` defaults to "root" if unspecified

    * `keys` when not specified, this class will first try to load your
       ssh agent keys; if no key can be found this way, `SshNode` will
       attempt to import the default ssh keys located in ``~/.ssh/id_rsa``
       and ``~/.ssh/id_dsa``.

    An instance of `SshNode` typically is needed to create a 
    :py:obj:`apssh.sshjob.SshJob` instance, that defines a batch of commands
    or file transfers to run in sequence on that node.

    A asynciojobs `Job` object that is set to

    As a subclass of ``AbstractJob``, this allows you to

    If ``verbose`` is set to a non-None value, it is used to 
    set - and possibly override - the verbose value in all the
    `commands` in the job

    ``commands`` can be set as either

    * (1) a list/tuple of ``AbstractCommand`` objects e.g.::

        commands = [ Run(..), RunScript(...), ..]

    * (2) a single instance of ``AbstractCommand``, e.g.::

        commands = RunScript(...)

    * (3) a list/tuple of strings, in which case a single ``Run`` object is created, e.g.::

        commands = [ "uname", "-a" ]

    * (4) a single string, here again a single ``Run`` object is created, e.g.::

        commands = "uname -a"

    For convenience, you can set either ``commands`` or ``command``, 
    it is equivalent but make sure to give exactly one of both.
