# Capture the current state of a project. Common datas so far:
# - commit (commit of the project or commit packaged/captured in distribution/other storage medium)
# - provider signature (repository, distribution, collection, ...)
#
# Later, possibly:
# - other numbers (trend, healthiness, ...)
#
# The snapshot is a product of ProjectCapturer.
