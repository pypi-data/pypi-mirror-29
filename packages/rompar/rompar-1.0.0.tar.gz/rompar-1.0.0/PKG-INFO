        Original message:
        
        Note that this initial version is very much a quick-and-dirty 'see if this method is useful'
        kind of tool. If it is, hopefully it will evolve into something pretty and elegant!
        
          usage: rompar.py <IMAGE> <BITS PER GROUP> <ROWS PER GROUP> [GRID FILE]
        
        Hit 'h' when the image has focus to produce some keystroke help in the calling window.
