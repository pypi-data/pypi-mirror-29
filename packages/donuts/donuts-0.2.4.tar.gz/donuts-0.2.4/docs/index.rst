    Donuts is still under development. API changes can happen, and the
    conde is not in a stable state. Please let us know if there is something
    that can be improved.

Motivation
----------

We operate and have access to several telescopes (NGTS, NITES, Warwick 1m, 1.5m San Pedro Martir) that require precise autoguiding. Sometimes we must defocus the telescope for various reasons, but we'd still like to autoguide. Donuts was designed to allow this. It had to be simple, fast and accurate. It works well as an autoguiding algorithm for equatorial telescopes (no field rotation). 

The process for aligning apertures for photometry is essentially the reverse. Rather than correcting the telescope pointing, the apertures must track the drift of the stars. Donuts can therefore be used to track the stellar positions for CCD photometry also. 

By default Donuts measures frame-to-frame translational offsets (X and Y) using all the stars in the image. This can be adjusted in the settings to select a specific region of interest (for extremly wide or distorted fields). 

The algorithm has its limitations. It currently does not deal with rotation and large drifts, where the field moves by approx. half a FOV or more. Our paper describing the details can be found here:
