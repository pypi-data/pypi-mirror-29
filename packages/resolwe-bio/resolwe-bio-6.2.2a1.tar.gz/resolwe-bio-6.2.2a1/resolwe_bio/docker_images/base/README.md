# Base Docker images

The `ubuntu-14.04` and `ubuntu-16.04` images are based on
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-14.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/) and
[`resolwe/base:ubuntu-16.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/resolwe/base/),
respectively.

These base images should be used for writing any new processes that are
considered for inclusion into Resolwe Bio.
