# pymer4

Love multi-level-modeling using lme4 in R but prefer to work in the scientific Python ecosystem? Then this package has got you covered! It's a small convenience package wrapping the basic functionality of [lme4](https://github.com/lme4/lme4)\*.  
\* *Currently this only includes linear and logit models*

This package can also estimate standard, robust, and permuted regression models\*  
\* *Currently this only includes linear models*

#### Documentation
Current documentation and usage examples can be found **[here](http://eshinjolly.com/pymer4/)**.

#### Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
You need *both* Python (2.7 or 3.6) and R (>= 3.2.4) on your system to use this package in addition to the following R packages (*pymer4 will NOT install R or R packages for you!*):
```
lme4>=1.1.12
lmerTest>=2.0.33
lsmeans>=2.25
```

#### Installation  

1. Method (stable)

    ```
    pip install pymer4
    ```

2. Method 2 (latest)

    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/ejolly/pymer4
    ```
