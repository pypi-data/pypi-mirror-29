figgy
=====

Are you sick and tired of writing packages or apps that are super great
but don’t work unless your end-user scours your README for instructions
on how to structure config files and how and where to instantiate them?

figgy is the app and package configuration generator package developed
for developers who develop apps and/or packages for use by other
developers.

figgy allows you to ship code and have the end-user developer install
and configure it just by running your app or package. You can call it
from setup.py or bind it to whatever you like in your code so the
results of the new configuration are made immediately available to
whatever context the app or package will be used in.

--------------

Warning
-------

This software is in beta development. That said, this package should
work. Please report bugs.

Key caveats: \* Outputs your configuration data to the screen in some
cases. \* Only supports json \* Only available for python 3. \* You want
this module to prompt from TTY. \* You’re on a ’NIX system. \* You’re
okay figuring out how to make forcing a configuration regeneration for
the user on your own.

These are intended to guide feature development for future versions, but
in this state it should be useful nonetheless.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install figgy

Usage
-----

To prompt and generate a configuration but not load it into the
package/app context use:

::

    import figgy

    template = {
        'username': 'default',
        'password': 'anotherdefault'
    }

    figgy.make(template)

To prompt and generate a configuration then load the new configuration
data into the package/app context use:

::

    config = figgy.make(template, get=True)

and the end user will be prompted with:

::

    Enter value for "username"
    (return for default "default")': ▋userinput
    Enter value for "username"
    (return for default "default")': 
    Set "username" to "userinput" in ./config.json
    Enter value for "password"
    (return for default "anotherdefault")': ▋anotheruserinput
    Enter value for "password"
    (return for default "anotherdefault")': 
    Set "password" to "anotheruserinput" in ./config.json

and generate a ``config.json`` file:

::

    {"username": "userinput", "password": "anotheruserinput"}

By default figgy assumes a few things:

-  You want the file to be named ``config.json``
-  You want the file generated at the path the python code that executes
   it runs from
-  You don’t want to return the configuration data itself to the
   application context
-  The user interface is TTY.

But you can change most of that:

::

    template = {
        'PORT': '3000',
        'DEBUG': 'True'
    }
    figgy.make(data=template, filename='appconfig')
    Enter value for "PORT"
    (return for default "3000")': ▋8080
    Set "PORT" to "8080" in ./appconfig.json
    Enter value for "DEBUG"
    (return for default "True")': ▋False
    Set "DEBUG" to "False" in ./appconfig.json

::

    figgy.make(data=template, path='../configs/')
    Enter value for "username"
    (return for default "default")': ▋userinput
    Enter value for "username"
    (return for default "default")': 
    Set "username" to "userinput" in ../configs/config.json
    Enter value for "password"
    (return for default "anotherdefault")': ▋anotheruserinput
    Enter value for "password"
    (return for default "anotherdefault")': 
    Set "password" to "anotheruserinput" in ../configs/config.json

::

    figgy.make(data=template, get=True)
    Enter value for "username"
    (return for default "default")': ▋userinput
    Enter value for "username"
    (return for default "default")': 
    Set "username" to "userinput" in ./config.json
    Enter value for "password"
    (return for default "anotherdefault")': ▋anotheruserinput
    Enter value for "password"
    (return for default "anotherdefault")': 
    Set "password" to "anotheruserinput" in ./config.json
    {'./config.json': {'username': 'userinput', password: 'otheruserinput'}}
