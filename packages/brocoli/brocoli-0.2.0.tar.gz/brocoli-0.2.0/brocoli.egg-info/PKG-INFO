Description: Brocoli: Browse Collections for iRODS
        ======================================
        
        Brocoli application allows users to browse iRODS catalog collections in a simple
        Tkinter GUI.
        
        Install Brocoli
        ---------------
        
        Pre-requisites
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        For now, Brocoli runs on Linux platforms. There may be Microsoft Windows support
        in a not-so-far future.
        
        Brocoli needs a Python installation with Tkinter. Under
        `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com>`, you may have to install a specific package to
        get Tkinter.
        
        Python 2.7+ and 3.5+ are expected to work.
        
        Dependencies
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Brocoli depends on the following packages:
        
        - six: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six
        - python-irodsclient: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-irodsclient
        
        Installing with pip
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        From a command shell, run:
        
            ``pip install brocoli [--user]``
        
        If you don't have administrative privileges, you may need to use the ``--user``
        optional argument, in order to install Brocoli in your user account.
        
        Installing from source
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        #) Download Brocoli from https://github.com/mesocentre-mcia/brocoli
        #) from distribution directory, run ``python setup.py install [--user]``
        
        If you don't have administrative privileges, you may need to use the ``--user``
        optional argument, in order to install Brocoli in your user account.
        
        Using Brocoli
        -------------
        
        Run brocoli from a command shell:
        
            ``$ brocoli``
        
        Connections
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        At first run, Brocoli will use a default ``os`` connection that does nothing
        interesting except displaying a local directory. You will want to create a more
        useful connection with an iRODS catalog. Just configure it following the menus:
        
            Settings -> New Connection
        
        This will open a dialog where you can set the connection configuration.
        
        Now, you should be able to switch to the newly created connections by following:
        
            Settings -> Switch connection -> Your new connection name
        
        Navigating
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Sub-directories can be opened by clicking on the triangle icon before their
        name.
        
        File operations
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Operations on files and directories are accessible by right clicking on the
        target.
