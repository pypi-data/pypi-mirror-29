Description: Brocoli: Browse Collections for iRODS
        ======================================
        
        Brocoli application allows users to browse iRODS catalog collections in a simple
        Tkinter GUI.
        
        Install Brocoli
        ---------------
        
        Pre-requisites
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        For now, Brocoli runs on Linux platforms. There may be Microsoft Windows support
        in a not-so-far future.
        
        Brocoli needs a Python installation with Tkinter. Under
        `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com>`, you may have to install a specific package to
        get Tkinter.
        
        Python 2.7+ and 3.5+ are expected to work.
        
        Dependencies
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Brocoli depends on the following packages:
        
        - six: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six
        - python-irodsclient: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-irodsclient
        
        Installing with pip
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        From a command shell, run:
        
            ``pip install brocoli [--user]``
        
        If you don't have administrative privileges, you may need to use the ``--user``
        optional argument, in order to install Brocoli in your user account.
        
        Installing from source
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        #) Download Brocoli from https://github.com/mesocentre-mcia/brocoli
        #) from distribution directory, run ``python setup.py install [--user]``
        
        If you don't have administrative privileges, you may need to use the ``--user``
        optional argument, in order to install Brocoli in your user account.
        
        Using Brocoli
        -------------
        
        Run brocoli from a command shell:
        
            ``$ brocoli``
        
        Connections
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        At first run, Brocoli will appear empty. You will want to create a more
        useful connection with an iRODS catalog. Just configure it following the menus:
        
            Settings -> New Connection
        
        This will open a dialog where you can set the connection configuration. The
        configuration fields are:
        
        * ``Connection name`` - choose a name to identify the connection
        * ``Catalog type`` - choose ``os`` or ``irods3``. Currently, ``irods3`` is the
          only useful catalog available (``os`` is used for testing purposes only)
        * ``Root path`` - enter the catalog path you want to base your display from
        * ``Make default connection`` - check if you want Brocoli to open this
          connection at startup
        
        ``irosd3`` specific configuration fields:
        
        * ``Use irods environment file`` - check if you want to use iRODS v3 iCommands
          configuration file (usually ``~/.irods/.irodsEnv``)
        * ``iRODS host`` - the iRODS server DNS name you want to connect to (usually
          your iCAT Enabled Server)
        * ``iRODS port`` - depending on your iRODS instance (1247 is the default)
        * ``iRODS zone`` - the name of your iRODS zone
        * ``iRODS user name`` - your iRODS account name
        * ``iRODS default resource`` - the iRODS resource to use (optional)
        * ``Remember password`` - check if you want Brocoli to store your iRODS password
          (**dangerous**: although Brocoli scrambles the stored password, it may be easy
          to unscramble for someone who gained access to that value)
        * ``iRODS password``
        
        Now, you should be able to switch to the newly created connection by following:
        
            Settings -> Switch connection -> Your new connection name
        
        Navigating
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Sub-directories can be opened by clicking on the triangle icon before their
        name.
        
        You can base the display from a sub-directory by choosing ``Go to`` in the popup
        menu or entering its path directly in the navigation bar.
        
        The ``.`` special entry refers to the currently displayed directory (the path
        displayed in the navigation bar).
        
        The ``..`` special entry appears when visiting a subdirectory of the connection
        root path. It refers to the current path parent directory.
        
        File operations
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Operations on files and directories are accessible in a popup menu shown when
        right clicking on the target.
        
        File/directory operations
        
        * ``Download to local disk`` - download selected entry (recursively) to your
          local computer
        * ``Delete`` - delete selected entry (recursively) from the catalog
        * ``Properties`` - displays catalog specific properties of the selected entry
        
        Directory only operations
        
        * ``New directory`` - creates a subdirectory of the selected directory
        * ``Upload local files`` - uploads local files into the catalog under the
          selected directory
        * ``Recursive upload`` - recursively uploads the contents of a local directory
          to the catalog
        * ``Go to`` - rebase Brocoli navigation bar to the selected directory
