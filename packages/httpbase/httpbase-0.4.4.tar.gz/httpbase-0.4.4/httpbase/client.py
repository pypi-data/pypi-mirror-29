        This method does a few things:

              we care about (query params and URL templating variables).
            - Injects required headers (auth and content type).
            - Formats the full URL. Formats in things like resource ID's and attaches query params.
            - Finally sends request and returns the response.

        Args:
            route: The route for the request. Contains the path, HTTP method, template variable names for the URL and
                accepted query params.

            **kwargs: Takes several optional kwargs to build the request, these should look familiar as they are the
                kwargs that ``requests`` accepts:

                params:  Dictionary or bytes to be sent in the query string for the request.
                data:  Dictionary, bytes, or file-like object to send in the body of the request.
                json:  json to send in the body of the request.
                headers:  Dictionary of HTTP Headers to send with the
                cookies:  Dict or CookieJar object to send with the
                files:  Dictionary of ``'filename': file-like-objects`` for multipart encoding upload.
                auth:  Auth tuple or callable to enable Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.
                timeout:  How long to wait for the server to send data before giving up, as a float, or a
                    `(connect timeout, read timeout) <timeouts>` tuple.
                allow_redirects:  Set to True by default.
                proxies:  Dictionary mapping protocol or protocol and hostname to the URL of the proxy.
                stream:  whether to immediately download the response content. Defaults to ``False``.
                verify:  Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether we verify the server's TLS certificate,
                    or a string, in which case it must be a path to a CA bundle to use. Defaults to ``True``.
                cert:  if String, path to ssl client cert file (.pem). If Tuple, ('cert', 'key') pair.

                As well as any additional kwargs your client specific client methods might need.
