This is release 0.2.6 of ncbi-genome-download.

Highlights of this version include:

* Multiple formats, taxids, species, etc. can now be downloaded as once, see
  README for how to use this. Thanks to Ruben (@rhpvorderman).
* You can now save information on downloaded files in a tab-separated table
  similar to the assembly_summary.txt file NCBI provides. Thanks to Ryan
  (@rrwick).
