Description: ========
        Tilesman
        ========
        
        Given any photo, will create a pyramid of tiles split into different photo resolution levels,
        represented in a folder hierarchy. Each folder is named against the resolution level it
        represents, starting on L-1 (full resolution, most number of tiles) and going all the way down
        to 0 (1 x 1 resolution, a single layer). Number of resolution levels is defined by the
        equation L = 1 + ⌈log2 max(n, m)⌉
