screepsapi
==========

This is an unofficial client for the `Screeps <https://screeps.com/>`__
Unoffical API.

Since the API is unofficial it could in theory change at any time. In
practice though breaking changes are rare.

Setup:
------

Simply install the library using ``pip``.

Usage
-----

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate to the primary servers just supply a username and
password.

.. code:: python

    import screepsapi
    USER = "MyUsername"
    PASSWORD = "TimeTravelingSecretAgentForHire"
    api = screepsapi.API(USER, PASSWORD)

It is also possible to access private servers with the ``host`` and
``secure`` parameters.

.. code:: python

    import screepsapi
    USER = "MyUsername"
    PASSWORD = "TimeTravelingSecretAgentForHire"
    api = screepsapi.API(USER, PASSWORD, host="server1.screepspl.us:443", secure=True)

Note that by default private servers do not use SSL and all traffic is
unencrypted.

API
~~~

The API itself is a simple REST-based API. Each method in the api
library corresponds to a different endpoint for the API.

The best way to discover functionality is to read through the library
itself.

Console Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import screepsapi
    USER = "MyUsername"
    PASSWORD = "TimeTravelingSecretAgentForHire"
    api = screepsapi.API(USER, PASSWORD, host="server1.screepspl.us:443", secure=True)

    # Run "Game.time" on shard1 via the console
    api.console('Game.time', shard='shard1')

User Information Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    import screepsapi
    USER = "MyUsername"
    PASSWORD = "TimeTravelingSecretAgentForHire"
    api = screepsapi.API(USER, PASSWORD, host="server1.screepspl.us:443", secure=True)

    # Find the GCL for `tedivm`
    user = api.user_find("tedivm")
    print user["user"]["gcl"]

Socket
~~~~~~

Screeps provides a sizable amount of data over a websocket. This
includes console data and room details.

The best way to utilize the socket is to extend ``screepsapi.Socket``
and override the various abstract functions.
