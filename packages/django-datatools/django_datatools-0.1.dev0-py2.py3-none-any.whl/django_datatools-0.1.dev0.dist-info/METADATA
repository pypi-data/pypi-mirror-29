The purpose of this project is to provide tools for django data management. The main motivator for this project was to find a way to drastically speed up inserting millions rows of relatational data

More documentation to follow as it gets fleshed out. Right now it's solving one problem with the autoparts_api project where millions of rows have to be inserted and retrieved.
