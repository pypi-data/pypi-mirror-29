Important
---------

-  Before running ESST, you need to configure and start a multiplayer
   server at least once.
-  If you want to deactivate the dedicated server feature, open
   ``Saved Games\DCS\Config\dedicated.lua`` and set
   ``["enabled"] = false``

Modified files
--------------

-  The following DCS files are added or modified:

   -  ``Saved Games\DCS\Config\dedicated.lua``: used to control the
      dedicated server behaviour. Set ``["enabled"] = false`` to revert
      to standard DCS behaviour.
   -  ``Saved Games\DCS\Scripts\ESSTGameGUI.lua``: this file controls
      the hooks for the DCS API and runs a UDP socket and is
      automatically added by ESST.
   -  ``C:\DCS World\MissionEditor\modules\me_authorization.lua``: this
      file is edited to allow DCS to start directly in multiplayer
      server mode

**NOTE**: all files that are modified by ESST are backed-up before
edition.

Functionalities
---------------

The main functionnalities are:

-  Auto start and auto-restart DCS
-  Discord bot able to send and receive commands

   -  Upload a Mission file to Discord to send it to the server
   -  Load missions
   -  Restart the server
   -  CPU usage alerts
   -  Server status

-  Automatic download and activation of a mission file from a Github
   repository latest release

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tool is composed of three main parts:

-  The DCS server manager: this is responsible for spawning (or
   connecting to) a DCS.exe process. It will also try it's best to keep
   it alive, and restart it in case it crashes. This has been made
   possible by `Ciribob <https://forums.eagle.ru/member.php?u=112175>`__
   and `his method to auto-start a
   server <https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=160829>`__.
-  A UDP socket: this little one is responsible for enabling
   communication between DCS and ESST. Messages are sent back and forth
   between the two of them. DCS sends regular updates with the status of
   the server, the connected players list, etc., while ESST can send
   command to DCS, for example asking it to exit gracefully before a
   restart (this is achieved by installing a script in
   ``Saved Games\DCS\Scripts\ESSTGameGUI.lua``).
-  A Discord bot: this is a two communication between ESST and a Discord
   channel on the Wing's server. ESST publishes updates about the server
   status, and members of the server are able to send commands to the
   dedicated server via the same channel.

Discord bot commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see a list of commands available, type ``!help`` in the Discord
channel.

Along with the Discord commands that allow to **upload missions file via
drag-and-drop into a Discord channel**, ESST also

Installation
------------

**Note:** Since DCS is a 64 bit application, it is *strongly*
recommended to have a 64 bits Python executable as well.

**Note:** ESST will only run with Python 3.6 and newer.

If you are able to get a working virtual environment on your own, feel
free to skip the next step.

Create a virtual env
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download and install `Miniconda 64
   bit <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__
2. Start a command prompt in the "Scripts" folder of your Miniconda
   installation
3. Type: ``conda create -n ESST python=3.6``
4. When Conda asks for confirmation, say yes.
5. Activate your virtual environment with ``activate ESST``
6. The prompt will now have the ``(ESST)`` prefix, indicating your
   virtual environment is activated

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to *ALWAYS* activate your environment before
running the ``esst`` script, otherwise Windows will not be able to find
the script.

Initial setup
-------------

Create a Discord bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you'll need to create a Discord application:

1. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and click
   "New app"
2. Give it a name and click "Create app"
3. Click "Create a bot" and confirm
4. Under "App bot", next to "token", click "click to reveal" and note
   the token. This will be your **bot token**
5. Next, under "App details", copy your **Client ID**
6. Got to
   https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot,
   replacing "YOUR\_CLIENTID" in the URL with your actual **ClientID**
7. Add the bot to the server of your choice
8. On the server, make sure the bot has the right to manage channels, to
   be able to create its channel if needed. If you prefer not to give
   this role to the bot, you will need to create the channel indicated
   in ``DISCORD_CHANNEL`` config value

**IMPORTANT**: the bot can only be added to **ONE** server for the time
being.

Install ESST
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using a command prompt with your venv activcated, run the following
command:

.. code:: batch

    pip install esst

This will install ESST in your venv.

Disable Windows crash dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the DCS application crashes, Windows will by default show a dialog,
which will prevent ESST from restarting DCS. To disable that dialog,
open an elevated command prompt and execute the following commands:

.. code:: batch

    reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting" /v "DontShowUI" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

.. code:: batch

    reg add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting" /v "DontShowUI" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

Create the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a file named ``esst.ini`` .

The location of ``esst.ini`` can be one of: \* Arbitrary, and indicated
in the ``ESST_INI`` environment variable \* In your user directory
(``c:\users\<your name>\esst.ini``) \* In the directory of your choosing
(that directory will have to be the working directory when you run ESST)

A standard configuration file looks like this:

.. code:: ini

    [main]
    DEBUG = true (optional, default: false)
    SAVED_GAMES_DIR = C:\path\to\Saved Games\DCS

    [discord]
    bot_name = My slick bot
    channel = Some Discord Channel
    token = DISCORD_TOKEN
    motd = Hi guys!

    [dcs]
    PATH = C:\path\to\DCS World\bin\dcs.exe
    SERVER_NAME = My awesome server
    SERVER_PASSWORD = SERVER_SECRET_PASSWORD
    SERVER_MAX_PLAYERS = 64
    DCS_SERVER_STARTUP_TIME = 60 (optional, defaults: 120)
    DCS_PING_INTERVAL = 20 (optional, default: 30)

    [auto_mission] (optional)
    github_owner = 132nd-vWing
    github_token = SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN (optional)
    github_repo = 132nd-Virtual-Wing-Training-Mission-Tblisi

OS environment variables as config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Note:** all config values can be set either in the INI file, or in the
environment. The value ``PATH`` in the example below can be set in the
environment as ``DCS_PATH``.

.. code:: ini

    [dcs]
    PATH = C:\path\to\DCS World\bin\dcs.exe

The ``[main]`` section has no prefix.

**Note**: case in the INI file does not matter, but environment
variables *must* be upper-case.

[main]
^^^^^^

-  ``debug``: if true, debug messages will be printed on the console
-  ``SAVED_GAMES_DIR``: path to the ``DCS``\ folder in ``Saved Games``

[discord]
^^^^^^^^^

-  ``bot_name``: the name of your bot
-  ``channel``: channel name to use on the server (it will be created by
   the bot if it doesn't exist)
-  ``token``: the token of your Discord bot

[dcs]
^^^^^

-  ``path``: path to the DCS executable (``dcs.exe``)
-  ``server_name``: the name of the DCS multiplayer server
-  ``server_password``: the password for the DCS multiplayer server
-  ``server_max_players``: maximum amount of players allowed on the
   server
-  ``dcs_server_startup_time``: this is the maximum amount of time
   allowed between the moment the ``DCS.exe`` process is running and the
   moment when an actual multiplayer server is running. If that time is
   exceeded, an alert will be sent on Discord
-  ``dcs_ping_interval``: this is the maximum amount of time between
   pings over which the server will be considered unresponsive and will
   be restarted (pings are sent to ESST by DCS every 5 seconds).

[auto\_mission]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Those settings are optional. If provided, ESST will automatically
download the first ``*.miz`` asset from the latest release of a Github
repository, allowing you to simply upload your missions to Github, and
have ESST grab the latest version at startup.

-  ``github_owner``: owner (organization or user) of the repository
-  ``github_repo``: name of the repository
-  ``github_token``: your personal Github token; this is provided to
   bypass the Github API rate-limitation error, but it's totally
   optional

Running ESST
------------

Simply type ``esst``\ at the command prompt, with your venv activated.

Example batch file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: batch

    @echo off
    echo waiting 30 seconds
    ping 127.0.0.1 -n 30 > nul
    call activate ESST
    cd C:\Utils\ESST
    pip install --upgrade --no-cache esst
    esst
    pause

This batch file will: 1. Pause for 30 seconds (so you can run when the
computer starts) 2. Activate a virtual environment named ``ESST`` (note
that ``Miniconda\Scripts`` must be in the ``PATH`` for this to work) 3.
Change the working directory to ``C:\Utils\ESST``, assuming that's where
your ``esst.ini`` file is located 4. Grabe the latest version of ESST 5.
Run ESST 6. Pause the script, to show the potential errors

Log files
---------

ESST writes two log files, both located in ``Saved Games\DCS\Logs``.

-  ``esst.log`` is the log for the main application
-  ``esst-gamegui.log`` is the log for the ``ESSTGameGUI.lua`` script
