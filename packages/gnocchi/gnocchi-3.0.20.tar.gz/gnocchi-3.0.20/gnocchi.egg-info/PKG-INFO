        Gnocchi is a multi-tenant timeseries, metrics and resources database. It
        provides an `HTTP REST`_ interface to create and manipulate the data. It is
        designed to store metrics at a very large scale while providing access to
        metrics and resources information to operators and users.
        
        Gnocchi is part of the `OpenStack` project. While Gnocchi has support for
        OpenStack, it is fully able to work stand-alone.
