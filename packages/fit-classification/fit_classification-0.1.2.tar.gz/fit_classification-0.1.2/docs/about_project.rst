About this project
******************

**Classification portal** is a web application used at FIT, CTU [1]_.
It enables teachers to grade students' assignments and allows students
to view their results. This project has both a web interface and REST API [2]_.
The aim of creating a Python library for this portal was to provide
a convinient way to work with this API with Python methods and objects.
