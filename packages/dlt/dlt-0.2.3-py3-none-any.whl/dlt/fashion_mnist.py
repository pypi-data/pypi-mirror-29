Module to load the Fashion MNIST database of handwritten digits
See https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set
of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend
Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning
algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
