Description: SciExp² (aka *SciExp square* or simply *SciExp2*) stands for *Scientific
        Experiment Exploration*, which provides a framework for easing the workflow of
        creating, executing and evaluating experiments.
        
        The driving idea of SciExp² is that of quick and effortless *design-space
        exploration*. It is divided into the following main pieces:
        
        - Launchgen: Aids in defining experiments as a permutation of different
          parameters in the design space. It creates the necessary files to run these
          experiments (configuration files, scripts, etc.), which you define as
          templates that get substituted with the specific parameter values of each
          experiment.
        
        - Launcher: Takes the files of launchgen and runs these experiments on different
          execution platforms like regular local scripts or cluster jobs. It takes care
          of tracking their correct execution, and allows selecting which experiments to
          run (e.g., those with specific parameter values, or those that were not
          successfully run yet).
        
        - Data: Aids in the process of collecting and analyzing the results of the
          experiments. Results are automatically collected into a data structure that
          maintains the relationship between each result and the parameters of the
          experiment that produced it. With this you can effortlessly perform complex
          tasks such as inspecting the results or calculating statistics of experiment
          sub-sets, based on their parameter values.
