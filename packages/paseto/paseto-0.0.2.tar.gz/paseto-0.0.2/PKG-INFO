Description: Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens for Python
        ============================================
        
        This is an unofficial initial implementation of
        `PASETO: Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens <https://github.com/paragonie/past/>`_ for Python.
        
        This is not yet production-ready; use at your own risk.
        
        Forked from `https://github.com/JimDabell/pypast <https://github.com/JimDabell/pypast>`_,
        which was originally designed for an earlier spec of PASETO when it was still
        PAST.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        	pip install paseto
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This is still in early development. It has not been reviewed in a security
        audit yet, so please be aware that it is not expected to be ready for use in
        production systems.
        
        It currently only supports basic encrypt/decrypt of the "local" token type, V2.
        V1 is not as nice as V2, but we will accept a functional, clean, secure pull
        request for a V1 if you are interested.
        
        No claims are processed yet. This means you have to implement json encode/decode
        yourself, as well as checking expiration.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        	from paseto import PasetoV2
        	import secrets
        	my_key = secrets.token_bytes(32)
        	# > b'M\xd48b\xe2\x9f\x1e\x01[T\xeaA1{Y\xd1y\xfdx\xb5\xb7\xbedi\xa3\x96!`\x88\xc2n\xaf'
        	token = PasetoV2.encrypt(
                plaintext=b'plaintext is a bytes object that is encrypted',
                key=my_key,
                footer=b'footer is authenticated but not encrypted'
            )
            # > b'v2.local.ORiY6F6_uy391wB1my1LA9ANYgh7rih1bcAqswLqmuiKVaZmfmUfxB5off7gLwdHVwxc-QKIEAfEdzRNU5pHcrnefFO_aA4QQV15i_yKLyyOF9oURg.Zm9vdGVyIGlzIGF1dGhlbnRpY2F0ZWQgYnV0IG5vdCBlbmNyeXB0ZWQ'
        
        	parsed = PasetoV2.decrypt(
        		token, my_key
        	)
        	print(parsed['message'])
        	print(parsed['footer'])
