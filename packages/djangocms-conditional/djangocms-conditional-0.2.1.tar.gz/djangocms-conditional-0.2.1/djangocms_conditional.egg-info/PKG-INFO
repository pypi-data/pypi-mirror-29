        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The full documentation is at https://djangocms-conditional.readthedocs.org
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        1.  Install djangocms-conditional::
            pip install djangocms-conditional
        
        2. Add "djangocms_conditional" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'djangocms_conditional',
            ]
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the djangocms_conditional models.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Shows and hides child plugins according to group membership, as configured in the plugin instance.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        This plugin only prevents rendering of plugins, just like djangocms-timer,
        and is subject to the same limitations:
        
        In its current form, plugin won't save you from the queries to retrieve child
        plugins due to the way plugin rendering works in django CMS. Still, the
        ``render`` method of child plugins is not executed (and grandchildren plugins
        are not retrieved) with mitigating effect on performance hit.
