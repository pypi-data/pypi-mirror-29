Description: # delphi
        Framework for assembling and executing probabilistic models from textual
        evidence.
        
        # Requirements
        - The [eidos reader](https://github.com/clulab/eidos)
        - The [INDRA package](http://indra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        - Eidos will be used as a fat JAR through INDRA, so you should do `sbt assembly`
            in the `eidos` folder, and follow the instructions
            [here](https://gist.github.com/bgyori/37c55681bd1a6e1a2fb6634faf255d60)
            to get Eidos and INDRA to work together.
        
        # Usage
        
        Clone the directory, install the requirements:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/ml4ai/delphi
        cd delphi
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Add this directory to your `PYTHONPATH`
        
        ```
        export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
        ```
        
        Then, do
        
        ```
        FLASK_APP=delphi flask run
        ```
        and navigate your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
        
        To build the Sphinx API documentation, do:
        
        ```
        make
        ```

        This project is in its early stages, so the documentation is a bit sparse. We
        are working on it :)
