# Tensorbayes: Deep learning library for deep generative models in Tensorflow

Tensorbayes is a light-weight wrapper around Tensorflow that provides access to
functions useful for deep generative models. To a first-order approximation,
Tensorbayes is a Tensorflow analog to [Parmesan](https://github.com/casperkaae/parmesan).

# Installation
Tensorbayes requires the following dependencies:
1. numpy
2. tensorflow >= 0.12

To install, simply run:
```
pip install tensorbayes
```
