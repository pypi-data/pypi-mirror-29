This module consists simply of a simple parser that parses your facebook
messages from the archive of your facebook data and outputs them into a
json file.

This file is then meant to be used in an interactive web interface that allows
 you to explorer your Messenger history :
  - Persons most talked to
  - Days of the week
  - Length of Messages
  - Date of year
  - Time of day
  - Etc
