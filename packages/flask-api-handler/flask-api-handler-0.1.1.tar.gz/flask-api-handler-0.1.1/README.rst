# Flask API handler
A small wrapper for flask app to ease the endpoints creation

## Motivation
We have been using Flask-RESTful for most of our project for the past couple of years, and when we mapped exactly what we need from it, it was mostly the way it allows the user to add routing.

This small module replace for us this functionality, so I've desided to share it with whoever want to give it a try :wink: 

## Getting Started
This wrapper helps davide the Flask App into modules and to use __Class__ handlers instead of functions for views

## Prerequisites
The only requirement for this project is Flask
  
## Usage
```python
from flask import Flask

from api_handler import ApiHandler

form example import UserHandler
form example import PaymentHandler

app = Flask(__name__)

# Init the api handler 
api = ApiHandler(app)

# Add the endpoints 
api.add_handler('/user', UserHandler)
api.add_handler('/payment', PaymentHandler)
```

## TODO
*   Make pip installable
*   Add tests
