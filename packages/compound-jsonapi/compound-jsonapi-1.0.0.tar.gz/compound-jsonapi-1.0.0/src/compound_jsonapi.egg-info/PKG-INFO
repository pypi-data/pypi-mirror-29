Description: Compound JSONAPI
        ================
        
        The Compound JSONAPI package is an extension to `Marshmallow`_ and has been
        heavily influenced by `Marshmallow JSONAPI`_. The difference to
        `Marshmallow JSONAPI`_ is that the Compound JSONAPI is focused on loading
        and dumping objects to compound JSONAPI documents that contain all the
        serialised data, rather than using JSONAPI's link functionality. It has one
        main advantage over `Marshmallow JSONAPI`_ in that it can load and dump full
        circular graph structures.
