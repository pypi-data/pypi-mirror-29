"""Measurement tools are meant to specify actions not covered by the tasks.

The class defined here are not meant to be used directly. One should rather
subclass one of their subclasses according to the kind of tool one wants to
create.

The existing kind of tools are the following :

- pre-measurement execution hook : used to perform additional operations before
  running a measurement. (see `hooks` package)
- monitors : used to follow the progress of a measurement. (see `monitors`
  package)
- post-measurement execution hook : used to perform additional operations after
  the measurement has been run. (see `hooks` package)
