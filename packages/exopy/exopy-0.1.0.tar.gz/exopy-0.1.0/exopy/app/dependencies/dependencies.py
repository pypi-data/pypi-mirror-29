"""Extension used to declared dependencies on some objects for execution or
rebuilding of an existing structure.

Dependencies allows to collect before hand (when the full workbench is
available) as set of of objects (classes, definitions, ...) and then use it
later to in a workbench free environment to rebuild or execute some code.
Those mechanisms are used to collect task classes (build) and
also drivers classes and intsrument profiles (runtime)
