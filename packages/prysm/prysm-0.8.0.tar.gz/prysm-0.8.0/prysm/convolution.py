        Notes
        -----
        The algoithm works according to the following cases:
            1.  Both self and other have analytical fourier transforms:
                - The analytic forms will be used to compute the output directly.
                - The output sample spacing will be the finer of the two inputs.
                - The output window will cover the same extent as the "wider"
                  input.
                - This may mean the output array is not of the same size as
                  either input.
                - An input which contains a sample at (0,0) may produce an output
                  without a sample at (0,0) if the input samplings are not ideal.
                  To ensure this does not happen if it is undesireable, ensure
                  the inputs are computed over identical grids containing 0 to
                  begin with.
            2.  One of self and other have analytical fourier transforms:
                - The input which does NOT have an analytical fourier transform
                  will define the output grid.
                - The available analytic FT will be used to do the convolution
                  in fourier space.
            3.  Neither input has an analytic fourier transform:
                3.1, the two convolvables have the same sample spacing to within
                     a numerical precision of 0.1 nm:
                    - the fourier transform of both will be taken.  If one has
                      fewer samples, it will be upsampled in Fourier space
                3.2, the two convolvables have different sample spacing:
                    - The fourier transform of both inputs will be taken.  That
                      which has a lower nyquist frequency will have a linear
                      taper applied between its final value and 0 to extent its
                      frequency range to that of the finer grid.  Interpolation
                      will also be used to match the sample points in fourier
                      space.

        The subroutines have the following properties with regard to accuracy:
            1.  Computes a perfect numerical representation of the continuous
                output.
            2.  If the input that does not have an analytic FT is unaliased,
                computes a perfect numerical representation of the continuous
                output.  If it does not, the input aliasing limits the output.
            3.  Accuracy of computation is dependent on how much energy is
                present at nyquist in the worse-sampled input.
