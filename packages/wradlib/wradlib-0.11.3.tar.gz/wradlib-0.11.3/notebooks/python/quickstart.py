# # A quick start to Python

# In order to use $\omega radlib$, you need to be able to use Python. 

# This notebook will 
# - give you a glimpse of the Python language, 
# - confront you with some Python exercises, 
# - and refer you to further in-depth courses for learning Python.   

# ## Hello interpreted world

# Python is an interpreted language just as e.g. R, Matlab and many others. In contrast to a compiled languages such as C, C++ or Fortran, each command is immediately interpreted by the Python interpreter. In this case, executing the following cell produces an immediate output.

# In[ ]:


print("Hello interpreted world.")


# ## Writing a program in Python

# Instead of entering this command interactively in a Python console (or a jupyter cell, as in this case), you can also write a **Python script** (or, in other words, a Python "program").

# - Use a text editor to create a file, 
# - add the line `print("Hello interpreted world.")`, 
# - save the file under the name `demoscript.py` 
# 
# (by convention, Python scripts should have the extension `.py`). 

# Now execute your script from any shell (or the DOS console on Windows): 
# 
# `$ python demoscript.py`

# Note that this will work only if you open the shell in the *same directory* in which you saved your script. Otherwise, you need to provide the full path like e.g.
# 
# *Under Linux/OSX:*
# 
# `$ python /home/user/path/to/demoscript.py`
# 
# *Under Windows:*
# 
# `> python e:\path\to\demoscript.py`

# ## Important data types

# Python knows various standard data types such as 
# - `integer`,
# - `float`,
# - `bool`,
# - and `str`. 

# If you define a variable, Python typically assigns the *type* of that variable for you.  

# In[ ]:


x1 = 2
print("x1 is of %r" % type(x1))

x2 = 2.3
print("x2 is of %r" % type(x2))

x3 = True
print("x3 is of %r" % type(x3))

x4 = x1 * x2
print("x4 is of %r" % type(x4))

x5 = "Hello interpreted world."
print("x5 is of %r" % type(x5))


# As you noticed in the above cell, you can inspect the data type of a variable by using function `type()`. Python has a plethora of data types beyond the standard ones shown above. See for example:

# In[ ]:


print( type(sum) )
print( type(type) )


# ## Other data types: collections

# Further important data types (and specific to Python) are so called `data collections` (or `containers`), namely 
# 
# - lists (`list`), 
# - dictionaries (`dict`),
# - and tuples (`tuple`).

# ### Lists

# A list is an ordered collection of objects which may have different types.

# In[ ]:


# a list
l = [1, "Paris", 3.0]
# a list is "mutable" (i.e. you can change the values of its elements)
l[1] = 2
print(l)
print(l[0:2])


# ## Excursus: indexing in Python

# You might have noticed that the index `1` refers to the second element of the list. 
# 
# This is an important rule for all containers in Python: **indexing begins with 0** 
# 
# *(which is familiar e.g. to C programmers, and new e.g. to R programmers)*

# ## Dictionaries

# - a `dictionary` is basically an efficient table that maps `keys` to `values`. 
# - it is an unordered container. 
# 
# There are two ways to define dictionaries - both are equivalent.

# In[ ]:


# One way to define a dictionary
d1 = {"band": "C", "altitude":1000.}

# Another way to define a dictionary
d2 = dict(band="C", altitude=1000.)

# Both are equivalent
print("d1 equals d2 is a %r statement " % (d1 == d2) )
print("The type of d1 is %r" % type(d1) )


# A `dictionary` can be queried using their keywords. You can also iterate over the keys.

# In[ ]:


print(d1["band"])
print("Printing all keys and values of d1:")
for key in d1.keys():
    print("\t%s: %r" % (key, d1[key]) )


# ## Control flow

# Loops or iterations as well as conditional statments are key to data processing workflows. 

# In this section, we will present the most important syntax for control flow.  

# ### "for" loops

# In[ ]:


# For loops
for i in range(3):
    print(i)


# **Indentation in Python**
# 
# Indentation is a mandatory element of Python syntax - not just a question of style. 
# 
# Not using indentation will raise an `IndentationError`.

# ### "while" loops

# In[ ]:


# While loops (in case the number of iterations is not known a-priori)
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1


# ### Conditional statements

# In[ ]:


# Conditional statements
a = 5
if a < 10:
    print("a is less than 10.")
elif a == 10:
    print("a equals 10.")
else:
    print("a is greater than 10.")


# You can also exit a loop before it is finished or skip parts of a specific iteration.

# In[ ]:


for i in range(3):
    # Exit the loop already if i equals 1
    if i == 1:
        break
    print(i)


# In[ ]:


for i in range(3):
    # Skip the iteration if i equals 1 (but continue the loop)
    if i == 1:
        continue
    print(i)


# ## Importing functions from modules

# For most applications, you will need to use `functions` that are available in `modules`. Just think of a module as a collection (or library) of functions. Some are shipped with the Python interpreter ([Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/)), others (such as wradlib) need to be installed (e.g. from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)) or using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) Package Manager (`conda`).
# 
# In order to use a function from a module, you need to `import` the module. See e.g. how to import the `os` module and use its `getcwd` function (which retruns the path to the current working directory):

# In[ ]:


import os
mycwd = os.getcwd()
print(mycwd)


# ## Getting help

# - In most environments, you can use the *TAB* key for code completion and for listing functions available in a module. 
# 
# - Use the following cell, enter `os.` and hit the *TAB* key. You can narrow down available functions by typing further characters. 
# 
# - Once you've selected (or typed) a function name, *jupyter* will show you the help content after hitting *TAB+Shift*.
# 
# - Alternatively, you can get help for a function in any Python environment by calling `help` (e.g. `help(os.getcwd)`). In juypter, you can also use the following syntax: `os.getcwd?`

# ## Writing your own functions

# In order to organise applications and write reusable code, you will need to write funcions on you own. 
# 
# This is how you define and call a function (notice again the **indentation**): 

# In[ ]:


# Define the function...
def demofunction(a, b):
    c = a + b
    return(c)


# In[ ]:


# ...and call the function
demofunction(2,3)


# Using `docstrings`, you can document your function as you write it.

# In[ ]:


def demofunction(a, b):
    """This function computes the sum of a and b.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : numeric
    b : numeric
    
    Returns
    -------
    output : numeric (the sum of a and b)
    
    """
    c = a + b
    return(c)


# Now try calling `help(demofunction)`.

# This should be the output:
# 
# ```python
# Help on function demofunction in module __main__:
# 
# demofunction(a, b)
#     This function computes the sum of a and b
#     
#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     a : numeric
#     b : numeric
#     
#     Returns
#     -------
#     output : numeric (the sum of a and b)
# ```

# Functions can have keyword arguments with default values. In the following example, we set a default value for parameter `b`.

# In[ ]:


def demofunction(a, b=2):
    """Adds 2 to a by default.
    """
    c = a + b
    return(c)


# In[ ]:


print(demofunction(3))
print(demofunction(3, b=3))


# ## File input and output

# This is the basic way to read from and write to text and binary files (there are a lot of other file formats which have specific interfaces - particularly in the radar world: see [file formats supported by wradlib](../fileio.ipynb)).

# In[ ]:


# Open a file for writing
f = open('testfile.txt', 'w') # opens the workfile file
print(type(f))    
f.write('This is a test line,\nand another test line.\n')   
f.close()


# In[ ]:


# Open a file for reading
f = open('testfile.txt', 'r')
s = f.read()
print(s)
f.close()


# A safer way to handle files is to use Python's `with` statement which makes sure that the file is properly closed even if your code breaks inbetween opening and closing the file. 

# In[ ]:


with open("testfile.txt") as f:
    s = f.read()
    print(s)


# ## The building blocks of scientific Python

# With this, we conclude the basic Python intro. 
# 
# The following sections introduce, we introduce the most important packages for scientific computing in Python. Unlike Matlab, Scilab or R, Python does not come with a pre-bundled set
# of modules for scientific computing. Instead, a scientific computing environment can be obtained by combining these building blocks:
# 
# * **Python**, a generic and modern computing language, including standard data types and collections, flow control, modules of the standard library, and development tools (automatic testing, documentation generation)
# 
# * **IPython**: an interactive **Python shell**, see our article on [how to use notebooks](../../jupyter.rst).
# 
# * **Numpy**: provides powerful **numerical arrays** objects, and routines to
#   manipulate them - see our [NumPy intro article](../python/numpyintro.ipynb)
# 
# * **Matplotlib** : visualization and "publication-ready" plots, see related intro [here](../python/mplintro.ipynb)
# 
# * **Scipy**: high-level data processing routines - e.g. optimization, regression, interpolation, etc (http://www.scipy.org)

# Please also check out further in-depth courses such as
# - the [SciPy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html) or 
# - the [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) book.
