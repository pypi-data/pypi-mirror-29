Automatic Login
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clanvas will look for a ``.clanvasrc`` file in your home directory to
execute initial commands. Here you can insert the login command so that
logging in is done automatically on start-up

::

    echo "login https://canvas.school.edu bOYc5cOIldA3eB9NTr7X0Um9Z8TPMACb0HtdgHTMtp10T5UKH0b4HOqTmOCvWZlYRpJ9dN" > ~/.clanvasrc

Additionally, you should change the permissions of this file so that
other users of your computer cannot read your API token and consequently
access your account.

::

    chmod 600 ~/.clanvasrc

Available Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Clanvas shell, all commands already on your system PATH are
available.

In addition, the shell provides the following commands:

+---------+-----------------------+
| Command | Meaning               |
+=========+=======================+
| lc      | list classes          |
+---------+-----------------------+
| cc      | change current class  |
+---------+-----------------------+
| la      | list assignments      |
+---------+-----------------------+
| lg      | list grades           |
+---------+-----------------------+
| wopen   | open in web interface |
+---------+-----------------------+
| whoami  | show login info       |
+---------+-----------------------+
| quit    | quit the shell        |
+---------+-----------------------+

Use the ``-h`` flag to show usage details for any command.

Generating an API Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Navigate to /profile/settings
2. Under the “Approved Integrations” section, click the button to
   generate a new access token.
3. Once the token is generated, you cannot view it again, so you’ll have
   to generate a new token if it is lost.

Contributing
------------

Currently the project is in an exploratory phase. I am implementing
features that that I find useful and trying to tweak them as I go along
to find a balance of easy-to-use and powerful. I would greatly
appreciate feedback about what is missing or what interfaces should be
changed.

Once the general interfaces and most core commands are solidified, then
tests will be added and a formal TODO list may be created.
