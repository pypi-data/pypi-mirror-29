        This is a simple python utility with similar functionality to the functionality
        of the ``homesick`` ruby utility, providing a simple interface for managing
        dotfiles via git repositories.
        
        This tool was born out of frustration at attempting to use ruby gems on HPC
        systems, where I did not have administrative rights. On such systems, which are
        often not the bleeding edge of ruby version, getting gems to work has proved
        extremely difficult. Installation of a new ruby version with associated rubygem
        was possible sometimes, but not often enough.
        
        Aims
        ----
        
        This tool replicates the most basic functionalities of ``homesick``, namely
        
        1. Cloning git repositories to the appropriate location
        2. Pulling repositories
        3. Automatic creation of symbolic links to dotfiles in repos
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Code is written to be compatible with both Python 2.6+ and 3.x, and
        deliberately avoids using any modules outside the standard library, so that it
        works out-of-the-box on any system with a reasonably modern Python interpreter
        installed.
