Description:     This is the fax.ir API v2 developed for third party developers and organizations. In order to have a better coding experience with this API, let&#39;s quickly go through some points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - This API assumes **/accounts** as an entry point with the base url of **https://api.fax.ir/v2**. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - This API treats all date and times sent to it in requests as **UTC**. Also, all dates and times returned in responses are in **UTC**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Once you have an access_token, you can easily send a request to the resource server with the base url of **https://api.fax.ir/v2** to access your permitted resources. As an example to get the user&#39;s profile info you would send a request to **https://api.fax.ir/v2/accounts/self** when **Authorization** header is set to \&quot;Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\&quot; and custom header of **x-fax-clientid** is set to YOUR_CLIENT_ID  # noqa: E501
