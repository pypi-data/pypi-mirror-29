Description
-----------

**gitcd** is a little helper for continuous integration workflows using
git as scm.

Installation
------------

Since gitcd is using python3 by default, you better upgrade.
Unfortunately installing kivy by script is not that easy, therefore you need to take some extra manual work. I might takle this in future releases.

After successful installation of python3 and pip for pyhton3, install the following prerequisites:


- MacOSX:

.. code:: console

    brew install pkg-config sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer gstreamer
    pip3 install -I Cython==0.25.2
    pip3 install kivy
    pip3 install kivymd

- Debian/Ubuntu:

.. code:: console

    apt-get install python3-kivy
    pip3 install kivymd

Then you are ready to install gitcd with the following command:

.. code:: console

    pip3 install --user --upgrade gitcd

If you are on mac osx and your local python folder isn't in your PATH variable you might add it to $PATH or symlink it in /usr/local/bin with sudo.

**Max OSX**

.. code:: console

    sudo ln -s /Users/<username>/Library/Python/<python-version>/bin/git-cd /usr/local/bin/

The same applies to linux, however, the path is different. (On usual Distributions this is in $PATH already)

.. code:: console

    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/git-cd /usr/local/bin/

Argument Completion
-------------------

Gitcd supports argument completion, to activate this feature in linux run:

.. code:: console

    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3

Under OSX it isn't that simple unfortunately. Global completion requires bash support for complete -D, which was introduced in bash 4.2. On OS X or older Linux systems, you will need to update bash to use this feature. Check the version of the running copy of bash with echo $BASH_VERSION. On OS X, install bash via Homebrew (brew install bash), add /usr/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells, and run chsh to change your shell.
Afterwards you might be able to also just run:

.. code:: console

    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3

Usage
-----

Check version and upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gitcd is aware of it's local and remote versions and may upgrade itself if you want to.

.. code:: console

    git cd upgrade


Initialize a project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cd into one of your local directories
representing a git repository and run the init command. Pass your configuration, for most cases the default values should be ok.

.. code:: console

    git cd init


Pull request status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are able to see the status of a feature
branch including the pull request and if it has already been reviewed by
someone.

.. code:: console

    git cd status


Clean up local branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tool is able to cleanup all local
branches which doesent exist on the origins. This is done with the clean command.

.. code:: console

    git cd clean


Start new feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starts a new feature branch from your master branch. If you dont pass a branchname, you will be asked later.

.. code:: console

    git cd start <branchname>


Test a feature branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Merges a feature branch into your development branch. If you dont pass a branchname, your current branch will be taken.

.. code:: console

    git cd test <branchname>


Open a pull request for code review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opens a pull request to your master branch. If you dont pass a branchname, your current branch will be taken.

.. code:: console

    git cd review <branchname>


Finish a feature branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Merges it into your master and asks for permission to delete your
feature branch. If you dont pass a branchname, your current branch will be taken.

.. code:: console

    git cd finish <branchname>


Compare your current branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compares your current branch against the given branchname or the latest
tag if none is given.

.. code:: console

    git cd compare <branchname>


Tagging the master branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates a tag from your master branch and pushes it to remote.

.. code:: console

    git cd release
