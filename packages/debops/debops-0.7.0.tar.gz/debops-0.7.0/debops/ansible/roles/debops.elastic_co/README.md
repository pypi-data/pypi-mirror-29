The `debops.elastic_co` Ansible role can be used to configure APT
repositories maintained by the [Elasticsearch BV](https://www.elastic.co/about)
company on Debian and Ubuntu hosts. The APT repositories are used to distribute
`elasticsearch`, `logstash`, `kibana`, `filebeat`, `metricbeat`,
`packetbeat` and `heartbeat` APT packages. The role allows only for
installation of these packages, additional configuration and management of the
installed software is performed by other Ansible roles.
