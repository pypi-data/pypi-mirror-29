The ``debops.authorized_keys`` role can be used to manage SSH keys centrally in
the ``/etc/ssh/authorized_keys/`` directory. The role only manages the keys
themselves, you should configure the ``sshd`` service to use them separately,
for example by using the ``debops.sshd`` Ansible role.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.authorized_keys
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.authorized_keys` can be found in the
[official debops.authorized_keys documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-authorized_keys/docs/).


### Role dependencies

### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
