[Kibana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibana) is a web-based dashboard which
can be used to display and analyze data stored in an Elasticsearch cluster. It
is a part of the Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) stack. The software is
developed by [Elastic](https://elastic.co/).

The `debops.kibana` Ansible role can be used to deploy Kibana behind an
`nginx` reverse proxy which connects to a local or remote Elasticsearch
cluster. The role can be used as a dependency by other Ansible roles to allow
control over their configuration options in the Kibana configuration file.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.3.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.kibana
