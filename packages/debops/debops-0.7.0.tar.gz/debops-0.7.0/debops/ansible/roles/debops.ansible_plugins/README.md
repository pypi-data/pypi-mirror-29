Ansible can be extended in various ways by the use of [custom plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html).
This role contains a set of custom Ansible plugins used by various DebOps
roles. The plugins are enabled by including this role as a dependency of
another role.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.3.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.ansible_plugins
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.ansible_plugins` can be found in the
[official debops.ansible_plugins documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-ansible_plugins/docs/).



### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
