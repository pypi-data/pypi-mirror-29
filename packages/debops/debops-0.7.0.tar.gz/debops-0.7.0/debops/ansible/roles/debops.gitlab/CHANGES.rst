`debops.gitlab master`_ - unreleased
------------------------------------

.. _debops.gitlab master: https://github.com/debops/ansible-gitlab/compare/v0.2.2...master

Added
~~~~~

- Add support for GitLab 10.0, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3. [bfabio_]

Removed
~~~~~~~

- Remove support for MySQL / MariaDB. If you used it, you must migrate the database:
  https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-recipes/tree/master/database/migrate-mysql-to-postgres
  [bfabio_]

Fixed
~~~~~

- Ensure version requirement of GitLab 8.17 (Git version >= 2.7.3) is met on Debian Jessie.
  [ypid_]

- Fix upgrade path for older deployments setup by the role. The issue was that
  the task "Stop gitaly service for an upgrade" tried to stop a service which
  which is created later in the run. [ypid_]

- Execute the :command:`bundle install` command until it runs correctly to
  ensure that https://rubygems.org/ timeouts don't break the installation
  process. [drybjed_]


`debops.gitlab v0.2.2`_ - 2017-08-16
------------------------------------

.. _debops.gitlab v0.2.2: https://github.com/debops/ansible-gitlab/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2

Added
~~~~~

- Add support for connecting GitLab to Piwik Analytics. [jpeeters]

- Add the ``libre2-dev`` APT package to required dependencies. [drybjed_]

- Add support for GitLab 9.4. [drybjed_]

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Compile required Go binaries in :command:`gitlab-shell` installation.
  [drybjed_]

- Stop and start running :command:`gitaly` service during an upgrade because
  the binary cannot be replaced without errors. Small bugs related to
  :command:`gitaly` service have been fixed. [drybjed_]


`debops.gitlab v0.2.1`_ - 2017-07-26
------------------------------------

.. _debops.gitlab v0.2.1: https://github.com/debops/ansible-gitlab/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Role documentation improvements. [ypid_]

- Add PATH environment for gitlab-workhorse service for artifact uploads. [cultcom]

- Add support for debian 'stretch'. [cultcom]

- Fix base packages installation for 'stretch'. [cultcom]

- Cleanup and simplify gitlab-workhorse service file.
  Standard input and output redirection does not work within systemd. [cultcom]

- Add support for GitLab 9.0, 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3. [bfabio_] [cultcom]

- Always create 'pages' directory for "rake backup" to succeed. [cultcom]


`debops.gitlab v0.2.0`_ - 2017-04-06
------------------------------------

.. _debops.gitlab v0.2.0: https://github.com/debops/ansible-gitlab/compare/v0.1.8...v0.2.0

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Change the installation procedure with a PostgreSQL database. The
  ``gitlab:setup`` Rake task drops the database, so instead the role runs the
  specific Rake tasks that install the schema and configure PostgreSQL database
  directly. This change should not affect existing installations. [drybjed_]

- Configuration of the ``pg_trgm`` PostgreSQL extension has been moved from the
  ``debops.gitlab`` role to dependent variables of the debops.postgresql_ role.
  [drybjed_]

- Variables in the :file:`vars/main.yml` file have been moved to the
  :file:`defaults/main.yml` file to allow their modification via Ansible inventory.
  [drybjed_]

- Configuration for other Ansible roles passed as role dependent variables has
  been moved to the :file:`defaults/main.yml` for easier management. [drybjed_]

- The configuration of the PostgreSQL database and roles has changed. The
  database will now be owned by a role of the same name (by default
  ``gitlabhq_production``) which cannot login to the server directly. The
  ``gitlab`` PostgreSQL role will belong to the ``gitlabhq_production``
  PostgreSQL group and should have access to the database.

  This change will be applied in the existing installations, but it shouldn't
  impact the service. [drybjed_]

- Rename the ``gitlab_database`` variable to :envvar:`gitlab__database` to
  allow switch to the Ansible playbook-based role dependencies. **If you
  configured the GitLab database in the inventory, you will need to update the
  inventory before applying the new role; otherwise the application will
  break.** [drybjed_]

- The role dependencies have been moved to the playbook. The ``debops.gitlab``
  role will now check if a suitable SQL database is available on the host
  before installing GitLab. If you are using a remote SQL database, you should
  check it's corresponding client role to prepare correct Ansible local facts.
  [drybjed_]

- The ``debops.gitlab`` role will check if PostgreSQL or MariaDB role facts are
  present on a host and will choose the installed database automatically. The
  PostgreSQL database is preferred to keep upstream preference.

  The selected SQL database is remembered in Ansible local facts. On existing
  installations this might result in a broken installation where a PostgreSQL
  database is detected without a corresponding fact pointing to a MariaDB
  database. In this case users should enforce the GitLab database choice
  through Ansible inventory. [drybjed_]


`debops.gitlab v0.1.8`_ - 2017-03-12
------------------------------------

.. _debops.gitlab v0.1.8: https://github.com/debops/ansible-gitlab/compare/v0.1.7...v0.1.8

Added
~~~~~

- Add support for GitLab 8.15. [Oldkarkass]

- Add support for GitLab 8.16. [cultcom]

- Add support for GitLab 8.17. [bfabio]

- Add support for GitLab services managed by :command:`systemd` units in
  a separate slice instead of the upstream SysVinit script. The role should
  preserve the current service management method on already installed
  instances; new :command:`systemd` support will be enabled only on new
  installs on hosts that use :command:`systemd` as the service manager.
  [cultcom, drybjed_]

- Add support for GitLab Pages. It will be enabled on GitLab 8.17+, as long as
  a suitable domain is configured in the ``gitlab_pages_domain`` variable.
  [bfabio]
