`debops.mariadb master`_ - unreleased
-------------------------------------

.. _debops.mariadb master: https://github.com/debops/ansible-mariadb/compare/v0.2.3...master


`debops.mariadb v0.2.3`_ - 2017-09-10
-------------------------------------

.. _debops.mariadb v0.2.3: https://github.com/debops/ansible-mariadb/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3

Added
~~~~~

- Support MySQL-Galera flavor from Codership. [ganto_]

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Use ``inventory_hostname`` as fallback for task delegation which should render
  manual definition of :envvar:`mariadb__delegate_to` unnecessary in case the client
  and server are setup on the same host and the inventory name doesn't
  correspond with the FQDN of the host. [ganto_]

- Generate client configuration in different files depending on the presence of
  :file:`/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/` directory. This should fix problems with
  Ansible configuration not applied on MariaDB on newer OS releases. [drybjed_]
