The [Postscreen](http://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html) Postfix
service can be enabled to filter out undesired SMTP clients on initial
connection to the mail server. Postscreen uses certain criteria (static
white/blacklist, DNS Block List queries, communication analysis) to allow or
deny connections for a given SMTP client.

This role can be used to enable and configure Postscreen in a Postfix
installation managed by the `debops.postfix` Ansible role. It does not
configure Postfix directly on its own.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.3.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.postscreen
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.postscreen` can be found in the
[official debops.postscreen documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-postscreen/docs/).



### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
