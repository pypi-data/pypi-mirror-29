The `debops.environment` role can be used to manage system-wide environment
variables, by default located in `/etc/environment` file. Variables are
gathered from multiple sources and combined to allow global/group/host tiered
environment modeled after Ansible inventory.

Role can also be used by other Ansible roles as a dependency to create global
environment variables in a safe way, that preserves idempotency.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.environment
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.environment` can be found in the
[official debops.environment documentation](http://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-environment/docs/).
