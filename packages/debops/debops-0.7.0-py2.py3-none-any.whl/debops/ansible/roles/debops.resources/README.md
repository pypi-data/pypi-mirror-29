This role allows management of custom file paths, file contents and archives on
remote hosts without the need to create a separate Ansible role. You can use
inventory lists to define what files to copy, what directories should exist on
a remote host, what online resources to download, etc.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.resources
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.resources` can be found in the
[official debops.resources documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-resources/docs/).



### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
