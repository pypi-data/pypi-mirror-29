[LibreNMS](http://www.librenms.org/) is a network monitoring dashboard written
in PHP. It can use SNMP, `collectd`, `check_mk` or other agents to gather
data from a variety of devices (switches, routers, servers, etc.) and graph
them using RRD. It's easy to use, and can perform autodiscovery to find and
monitor additional devices.

`debops.librenms` role will manage a central LibreNMS monitoring host and
web interface.
