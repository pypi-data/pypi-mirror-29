The `logrotate` package is used to periodically rotate logs, so that they
don't fill up the disk space on the filesystem. Rotated logs can be moved to
a different host or emailed before removal for archival purposes.

The `debops.logrotate` Ansible role allows you to manage log rotation
configuration for system packages, or create custom log configuration. The role
can be used by other roles as a dependency to make automatic `logrotate`
configuration easier.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v2.0.0`. To install it, run:

```Shell
ansible-galaxy install debops.logrotate
```

### Documentation

More information about `debops.logrotate` can be found in the
[official debops.logrotate documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-logrotate/docs/).



### Are you using this as a standalone role without DebOps?

You may need to include missing roles from the [DebOps common
playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml)
into your playbook.
