        =========
        
        pip-check gives you a quick overview of all installed packages and their
        update status. Under the hood it calls ``pip list --outdated --format=columns``
        and transforms it into a more user friendly table.
        
        .. important:: Requires ``pip`` Version 9 or higher!

        Installation::
        
            pip install pip-check
        
        Usage::
        
            $ pip-check
        
            # If your terminal does not support the table lines,
            # you can show an ASCII table
            $ pip-check --ascii
        
            # You can specify the pip executable
            $ pip-check --cmd=pip3
        
            # List only packages that are not dependencies of installed packages.
            $ pip-check --not-required
        
            # Some packages have ridiculous long versions. To admire them:
            $ pip-check --full-version
        
            # Do not show packages where their version is up to date:
            $ pip-check --hide-unchanged
        
            # Show the pip command to update all major/minor packages
            $ pip-check --show-update
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        
        v2.3.2 (2018-02-18):
            - New ``--show-update`` argument.
            - Fixed ``--full-versions`` argument.
            - Minor UI improvements.
        
        v2.1 (2018-02-18):
            - Complete new architecture. It now calls ``pip`` directly and parses
              it output which should be more reliable.
            - It's also using distutils for the version comparision now, which is
              more reliable as well.
            - Lots of features and bug fixes.
        
        v0.2 (2016-02-09):
            - Fixes issues with older pip versions.
            - Truncates extremly long version numbers.
        
        v0.1 (2016-02-06):
            - Very first version, and yet with very limited features.
