Description: 
        Jotting
        -------
        
        Logs that explain when, where, and why things happen.
        
        ``jotting`` is a log system for Python that can be used to record the causal
        history of an asynchronous or distributed system. These histories are composed
        of actions which, once "started", will begin "working", potentially spawn other
        actions, and eventually end as a "success" or "failure". In the end you're left
        with a breadcrumb trail of information that you can use to squash bugs with
        minimal boilerplate.
        
        Jotting was heavily inspired by ``eliot`` (https://eliot.readthedocs.io/).
