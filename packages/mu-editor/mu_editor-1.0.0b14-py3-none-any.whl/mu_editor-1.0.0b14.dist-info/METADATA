Mu - A Simple Python Code Editor 
================================

.. image:: docs/logo.png

Mu is a simple code editor for beginner programmers based on the feedback given
to and experiences of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's education team. Having said
that, Mu is for anyone who wants to use a simple "no frills" editor.

Mu is a modal editor with modes for Adafruit's CircuitPython, the micro:bit's
version of MicroPython and standard Python 3 (including a graphical debugger).
All modes make available a REPL (either running on the connected CircuitPython
or MicroPython device or as a Jupyter based iPython session in Python3 mode).

It's written in Python and works on Windows, OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.

We have `extensive developer documentation <https://mu.readthedocs.io/>`_
including a guide for
`setting up a development environment <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>`_, 
`contributor guidelines <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ and
`some suggested first steps <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first-steps.html>`_.

We want our community to be a friendly place. Therefore, we expect contributors
and collaborators to follow our
`Code of Conduct <https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html>`_.


Release History
---------------

1.0.0.beta.14
=============

* Add new PythonProcessPanel to better handle interactions with child
  Python3 processes. Includes basic command history and command editing.
* Move the old "run" functionality in Python3 mode into a new "Debug" button.
* Create a new "Run" button in Python3 mode that uses the new
  PythonProcessPanel.
* Automation of 32bit and 64bit Windows installers (thanks to Thomas Kluyver
  for his fantastic pynsist tool).
* Add / revise developer documentation in light of changes above.
* (All the changes mentioned above were supported by the Raspberry Pi
  Foundation -- Thank you!)
* Update / add USB PIDs for Adafruit boards (thanks Adafruit for the heads up).
* Minor cosmetic changes.
* Additional test cases.

1.0.0.beta.13
=============

* Fix to solve problem when restoring CircuitPython session when device is not
  connected.
* Fix to solve "data terminal ready" (DTR) problem when CircuitPython expects
  DTR to be set (and it isn't by default in Qt).
* Added initial work on developer documentation found here: http://mu.rtfd.io/
* Updates to USB PIDs for Adafruit boards.
* Added functionally equivalent "make.py" for Windows based developers.
* Major refactor of the micro:bit related "files" UI pane: it no longer blocks
  the main UI thread.

1.0.0.beta.12
=============

* Update "save" related behaviour so "save as" pops up when the filename in the tab is double clicked.
* Update the debugger so the process stops at the end of the run.
* Ensure the current working directory for the REPL is set to mu_mode.
* Add additional documentation about Raspberry Pi related API.
* Update micro:bit runtime to lates MicroPython beta.
* Make a start on developer documentation.

1.0.0.beta.11
=============

* Updated Python 3 REPL to make use of an out of process iPython kernel (to avoid problems with blocking Mu's UI).
* Reverted Save related functionality to prior behaviour.
* The "Save As" dialog for re-naming a file is launched when you click the filename in the tab associated with the code.

1.0.0.beta.10
=============

* Ensured "Save" button prompts user to confirm (or replace) the filename of an existing file. Allows Mu to have something like "Save As".
* Updated to latest microfs library for working with the micro:bit's filesystem.
* Fixed three code quality warnings found by https://lgtm.com/projects/g/mu-editor/mu/alerts/?mode=list
* Updated API generation so the output is ordered (helps when diffing the generated files).
* Updated Makefile to create Python packages/wheels and deploy to PyPI.
* Explicit versions for packages found within install_requires in setup.py. 
* Minor documentation changes.

1.0.0.beta.9
============

* Debian related packaging updates.
* Fixed a problem relating to how Windows stops the debug runner.
* Fixed a problem relating to how Windows paths are expressed that was stopping the debug runner from starting.

1.0.0.beta.8
============

* Updated splash image to reflect trademark usage of logos.
* Refactored the way the Python runner executes so that it drops into the Python shell when it completes.
* The debug runner now reports when it has finished running a script.

1.0.0.beta.7
============

* Update PyInstaller icons.
* Fix some tests that fail on older version of Python 3.
* Add scripts to extract API information from Adafruit and Python 3.
* Add generated API documentation to Mu so autosuggest and call tips have data.
* Ensure translation files are distributed.

1.0.0.beta.6
============

* Pip installable.
* Updated theme handling: day, night and high-contrast (as per user feedback).
* Keyboard shortcuts.

1.0.0.beta.*
============

* Added modes to allow Mu to be a general Python editor. (Python3, Adafruit and micro:bit.)
* Added simple visual debugger.
* Added iPython based REPL for Python3 mode.
* Many minor UI changes based on UX feedback.
* Many bug fixes.

0.9.13
======

* Add ability to change default Python directory in the settings file. Thanks to Zander Brown for the contribution. See #179.

0.9.12
======

* Change the default Python directory from ``~/python`` to ``~/mu_code``. This fixes issue #126.
* Add instructions for installing PyQt5 and QScintilla on Mac OS.
* Update to latest version of uFlash.
* Add highlighting of search mathes.
* Check if the script produced is > 8k.
* Use a settings file local to the Mu executable if available.
* Fix bug with highlighting code errors in Windows.
* Check to overwrite an existing file on the micro:bit FS.
* Start changelog
