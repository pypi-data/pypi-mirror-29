AntiNex Core
============

Automating network exploit detection using highly accurate pre-trained deep neural networks.

As of 2018-03-11, the core can repeatedly predict attacks on a Django application server by training using the Django AntiNex dataset with cross validation scores around **~99.8%** with automated scaler normalization.

Concepts
--------

The core is a Celery worker pool for processing training and prediction requests for deep neural networks to detect network exploits (Nex) using Keras and Tensorflow in near real-time. Internally each worker manages a buffer of pre-trained models identified by the ``label`` from the initial training request. Once trained, a model can be used for rapid prediction testing provided the same ``label`` name is used on the prediction request. Models can also be re-trained by using the training api with the same ``label``. While the initial focus is on network exploits, the repository also includes mock stock data for demonstrating running a worker pool to quickly predict regression data (like stock prices) with many, pre-trained deep neural networks.

This repository is a standalone training and prediction worker pool that is decoupled from the AntiNex REST API:

Install
-------

pip install antinex-core

Run
---

Please make sure redis is running and accessible before starting the core:

::

    redis-cli 
    127.0.0.1:6379>

With redis running and the antinex-core pip installed in the python 3 runtime, use this command to start the core:

::

    ./run-antinex-core.sh

Or with celery:

::

    celery worker -A antinex_core.antinex_worker -l DEBUG

Publish a Predict Request
-------------------------

To train and predict with the new automated scaler-normalized dataset with a 99.8% prediction accuracy for detecting attacks using a wide, two-layer deep neural network with the AntiNex Django dataset run the following steps.

Please make sure to clone the dataset repo to the pre-configured location:

::

    git clone https://github.com/jay-johnson/antinex-datasets.git /opt/antinex-datasets

::

    ./publish_regression_predict.py -f training/scaler-full-django-antinex-simple.json

    ./publish_regression_predict.py

JSON API
--------

The AntiNex core manages a pool of workers that are subscribed to process tasks found in two queues (``webapp.train.requests`` and ``webapp.predict.requests``). Tasks are defined as JSON dictionaries and must have the following structure:

::

    {
        "label": "Django-AntiNex-Simple-DNN",
        "dataset": "./tests/datasets/classification/cleaned_attack_scans.csv",

        },
        "version": 1
    }

Regression prediction tasks are also supported, and here is an example from an included dataset with mock stock prices:
