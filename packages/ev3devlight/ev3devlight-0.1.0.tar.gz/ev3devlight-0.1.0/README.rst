# ev3devlight
Lightweight ev3dev Micropython and Python library.

Try it with one of the [examples](https://github.com/laurensvalk/ev3devlight-examples).

Note that micropython only comes preinstalled on the [stretch versions of the latest SD card images](https://oss.jfrog.org/list/oss-snapshot-local/org/ev3dev/brickstrap/). The library should work on Jessie builds with Python too.
