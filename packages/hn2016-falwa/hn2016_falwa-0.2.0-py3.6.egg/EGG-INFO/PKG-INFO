Description: 
        hn2016_falwa is a package that contains modules to compute the finite-amplitude 
        local wave activity (FALWA) and reference state (U_ref) in the following papers:
        Huang and Nakamura (2016, JAS): http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1
        Huang and Nakamura (2017, GRL): http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073760/full
        The current version of the library handles calculation of FALWA in a spherical 
        barotropic model and QGPV fields on isobaric surfaces.
        
        The functions in this library can compute the tracer equivalent-latitude relationship 
        proposed in Nakamura (1996) (Also, see Allen and Nakamura (2003)) and the (zonal mean)
        finite-amplitude wave activity in spherical geometry as in Nakamura and Solomon (2010).
        
        v0.2.0:
        - Functions are structred in 4 different modules: basis, wrapper, utilities and beta_version. See documentation on Github for details.
