Description: 
        hn2016_falwa is a package that contains modules to compute the finite-amplitude 
        local wave activity (FALWA) proposed in Huang and Nakamura (2016 JAS):
        http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1
        The current version of the library handles calculation of FALWA in a spherical 
        barotropic model and QGPV fields on isobaric surfaces.
        
        The functions in this library can compute the tracer equivalent-latitude relationship 
        proposed in Nakamura (1996) (Also, see Allen and Nakamura (2003)) and the (zonal mean)
        finite-amplitude wave activity in spherical geometry as in Nakamura and Solomon (2010).
        
        v0.1.7:
        - Name of functions are all now in small letters.
        - The radius of planet (planet_radius) is now an optional input for the functions (default value: Earth's radius).
        - The function 'static_stability' can now take in 2D (i.e. zonal mean) or 3D field of potential temperature.
        - The syntax in the sample IPython notebooks are updated.
        - Unittest directory has been set up and will be constantly updated.
        - A new function 'theta_lwa' has been added to compute surface wave activity based on Potential temperature.
