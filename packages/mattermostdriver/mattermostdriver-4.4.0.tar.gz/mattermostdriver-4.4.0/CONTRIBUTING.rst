CONTRIBUTING
''''''''''''

Yes, please! Feel free to contribute to the project.

I would be glad if you do!
There are only a few things to keep in mind.

This project follows PEP 8, with one exception
 - This project uses tabs instead of spaces. Please do not submit PRs refactoring this.

If there are more exceptions from it, which I don't know about it, please try to be consistent!
And please try to avoid to mix big style changes with feature changes!

Thanks! :-)
