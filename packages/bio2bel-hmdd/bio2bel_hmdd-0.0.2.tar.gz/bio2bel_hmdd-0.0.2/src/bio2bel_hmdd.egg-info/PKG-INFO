        Abstract
        --------
        HMDD (the Human microRNA Disease Database) is a database that curated experiment-supported evidence for human microRNA (miRNA) and disease associations. miRNAs are one class of important regulatory RNAs, which mainly repress gene express at the post-transcriptional level. Increasing reports have shown that miRNAs play important roles in various critical biological processes. For their importance, the dysfunctions of miRNAs are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases. The first version of HMDD was built on December 2007. Each entry in HMDD v1.0 has four items for annotation; they are miRNA name, disease name, the reference PubMed ID, and the evidence supporting the miRNA-association from the original paper. During the past five years, we updated HMDD for more than 30 times. HMDD v2.0 presents more detailed and comprehensive annotations to the human miRNA-disease association data, including miRNA-disease association data from the evidence of genetics, epigenetics, circulating miRNAs, and miRNA-target interactions. In addition, a “submission” function was implemented in the version 2.
