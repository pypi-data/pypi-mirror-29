        **Main Features:**
        
        +  Parsing elegant (electron accelerator tracking code) lattice file (.lte) to be
           python dict or json string for further operations.
        +  Modeling accelerator magnetic elements, such as dipole, quadrupole, drift, etc. to be python
           objects, from EPICS control environment to OOP level.
        +  Support unit conversion between EPICS PV raw value and the physical real value of elements.
        +  Modeling lattice beamline from modeled elements, constructing Lattice instance, 
           dumping .lte file for code tracking.
        +  Feeding defined elements with new configuration, interfacing with EPICS environment, to form
           the close-loop online system.
        +  Visualizing the lattice layout by predefined elements' style.
        +  Friendly native-look GUI application to facilitate these functionalities.
