        `pretalx` provides a conference planning tool – read our extensive `feature
        list`_ in our docs to get a better idea of what `pretalx` can do for you,
        but it probably involves everything you'll need to curate submissions and
        contents for a conference with up to 100 talks.
        
        You can host pretalx yourself, as detailed in our `administrator documentation`_,
        or use our public instance at `pretalx.org`_.
