Description: Google Images Download
        ======================
        
        Python Script for 'searching' and 'downloading' hundreds of Google
        images to the local hard disk!
        
        Summary
        -------
        
        This is a command line python program to search keywords/key-phrases on
        Google Images and then also optionally download one or more images to
        your computer. This is a small program which is ready-to-run, but still
        under development. Many more features will be added to it going forward.
        
        Compatability
        -------------
        
        This program is compatible with both the versions of python (2.x and
        3.x). It is a download-and-run program with no changes to the file. You
        will just have to specify parameters through the command line. \_\_\_
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **Using pip:**
        
        ::
        
                $ pip install google_images_download
        
        **Manually:**
        
        ::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download.git
            $ cd google-images-download && sudo python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
                $ googleimagesdownload [Arguments...]
        
        Arguments
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        **Note:** If ``single_image`` or ``url`` parameter is not present, then
        keywords is a mandatory parameter. No other parameters are mandatory.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        -  If you have python 2.x version installed
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "Polar bears, baloons, Beaches" --limit 20``
        
        -  If you have python 3.x version installed
        
        ``python3 google-images-download.py --keywords "Polar bears, baloons, Beaches" --limit 20``
        
        -  Using Suffix Keywords allows you to specify words after the main
           keywords. For example if the ``keyword = car`` and
           ``suffix keyword = 'red,blue'`` then it will first search for
           ``car red`` and then ``car blue``
        
        ``python3 google-images-download.py --k "car" -sk 'red,blue,white' -l 10``
        
        -  To use the short hand command
        
        ``python google-images-download.py -k "Polar bears, baloons, Beaches" -l 20``
        
        -  To download images with specific image extension/format
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "logo" --format svg``
        
        -  To use color filters for the images
        
        ``python google-images-download.py -k "playground" -l 20 -c red``
        
        -  To use non-English keywords for image search
        
        ``python google-images-download.py -k "北极熊" -l 5``
        
        -  To download images from the google images link
        
        ``python google-images-download.py -k "sample" -u <google images page URL>``
        
        -  To save images in specific main directory (instead of in 'downloads')
        
        ``python google-images-download.py -k "boat" -o "boat_new"``
        
        -  To download one single image with the image URL
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "baloons" --single_image <URL of the images>``
        
        -  To download images with size and type constrains
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "baloons" --size medium --type animated``
        
        -  To download images with specific usage rights
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "universe" --usage_rights labled-for-reuse``
        
        -  To download images with specific color type
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "flowers" --color_type black-and-white``
        
        -  To download images with specific aspect ratio
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "universe" --aspect_ratio panoramic``
        
        -  To download images which are similar to the image in the image URL
           that you provided (Reverse Image search).
        
        ``python3 pr.py -si <image url> -l 10``
        
        -  To download images from specific website or domain name for a given
           keyword
        
        ``python google-images-download.py --keywords "universe" --specific_site example.com``
        
        ===> The images would be downloaded in their own sub-directories inside
        the main directory (either the one you provided or in 'downloads') in
        the same folder as the python file that you run.

        Disclaimer
        ----------
        
        This program lets you download tons of images from Google. Please do not
        download any image without violating its copyright terms. Google Images
        is a search engine that merely indexes images and allows you to find
        them. It does NOT produce its own images and, as such, it doesn't own
        copyright on any of them. The original creators of the images own the
        copyrights.
        
        Images published in the United States are automatically copyrighted by
        their owners, even if they do not explicitly carry a copyright warning.
        You may not reproduce copyright images without their owner's permission,
        except in "fair use" cases, or you could risk running into lawyer's
        warnings, cease-and-desist letters, and copyright suits. Please be very
        careful before its usage!
