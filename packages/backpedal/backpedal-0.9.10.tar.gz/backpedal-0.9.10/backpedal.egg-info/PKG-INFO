Description: 
        It's like `os.walk`, but backwards... and on a bicycle.
        
        ## Core Features
        
        - Walk directories up, down, or both directions
        - Search for files, directories, or both item types
        - Return first item found immediately, or list of all matching items
        - 100% Test Coverage (pytest)
        - 100% PEP8 Compliant (pep8, autopep8)
        
        ## Motivation?
        
        The primary use case for Backpedal is finding files from within your current directory, and/or parent(s).  For example, both Vagrant and Fabric support running from nested sub-directories within a project while loading their associated `Vagrantfile` or `fabfile.py` from the root (parent) project directory by searching from the current directory and upward.
