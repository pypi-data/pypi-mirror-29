        **Blog:** https://www.gollahalli.com/blog/export-your-github-and-gitlab-releases-as-a-changelog/
        
        This CLI exports your project releases to a markdown based on `keep a
        changelog <http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`__ and
        `markdownlint <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint>`__ and JSON,
        it currently supports GitHub and GitLab.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install release-exporter
        
        Or download this repository and type in the following in your
        terminal/cmd
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In your terminal/cmd, change to the folder where your repository is
        located and do the following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            rex --token <your token> markdown
        
        That's it. You should see a ``CHANGELOG.md`` in your folder.
        
        Advance Usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Release exporter has the following options
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           Usage: rex [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
        
           Options:
             --token TEXT     Token number if its a private repository.
             --url TEXT       URL of your repository. This is optional if your current
                              directory has .git folder with remote url.
             --location TEXT  Local location of your repository.
             --version
             --help           Show this message and exit.
        
           Commands:
             json      Creates JSON file.
             markdown  Creates markdown file.
             rest      Creates reStructuredText file.
        
        If you don't have a repository on your computer, but you still want to
        generate a change log you can manually add your repository URL as
        follows:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            rex markdown --token <your token> --url <your url>
        
        If you have your repository in a different location and you are lazy
        (like me) to change into that directory, get the absolute path of your
        repository add it to the ``--location <location>``.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            rex --token <your token> --location <absolute path>
        
        You can also export your releases to JSON file by just replacing
        ``markdown`` with ``json``. The output looks something like this:
        
        .. code:: json
        
            {
                "repositoryName": "release-exporter",
                "provider": "github.com",
                "owner": "akshaybabloo",
                "repoUrl": "https://github.com/akshaybabloo/release-exporter",
                "totalTags": 2,
                "data": [
                    {
                        "tagName": "Unreleased",
                        "description": "",
                        "createdAt": "",
                        "compareUrl": "https://github.com/akshaybabloo/release-exporter/compare/1.0.1...HEAD"
                    },
                    {
                        "tagName": "v1.0.1",
                        "description": "### Added\n- Unreleased tag added to the template and GitHub\n- Unreleased tag added to GitHub\n\n### Fixed\n- Tag missing in GitHub JSON fixed\n- Tag missing in GitLab JSON fixed",
                        "createdAt": "2018-01-16",
                        "compareUrl": "https://github.com/akshaybabloo/release-exporter/compare/v1.0...v1.0.1"
                    },
                    {
                        "tagName": "v1.0",
                        "description": "Initial release.",
                        "createdAt": "2018-01-15",
                        "compareUrl": null
                    }
                ]
            }
        
        
        Note that the ``Unreleased`` tag is not counted in ``totalTags``.
        
        Problems you might encounter
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        If you are using ``rex`` on your repository folder or if you are using
        ``--location`` you might get an error saying that there are duplicate
        keys, this is because sometimes the file ``.git/config`` has more than
        one ``[remote "origin"]``. In such case, it is best to give the URL of
        your repository by giving ``--url <repo URL>``.
