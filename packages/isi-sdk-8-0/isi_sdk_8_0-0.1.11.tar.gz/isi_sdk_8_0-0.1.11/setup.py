About
-----

This package is part of the Isilon SDK. It includes language bindings
for easier programmatic access to the OneFS API for cluster
configuration (on your cluster this is the REST API made up of all the
URIs underneath https://[cluster]:8080/platform/\*, also called the
"Platform API" or PAPI").

Installation
------------

``pip install PKG_NAME``

Example program
---------------

Here's an example of using the Python PAPI bindings to retrieve a list
of NFS exports from your cluster:

.. code:: python

    import PKG_NAME
    from PKG_NAME.rest import ApiException
    from pprint import pprint
    import urllib3
    urllib3.disable_warnings()

    # configure username and password
    PKG_NAME.configuration.username = "YOUR_USERNAME"
    PKG_NAME.configuration.password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
    PKG_NAME.configuration.verify_ssl = False

    # configure host
    host = "https://YOUR_CLUSTER_HOSTNAME_OR_NODE_IP_ADDRESS:8080"
    api_client = PKG_NAME.ApiClient(host)
    protocols_api = PKG_NAME.ProtocolsApi(api_client)

    # get all exports
    sort = "description"
    limit = 50
    dir = "ASC"
    try: 
        api_response = protocols_api.list_nfs_exports(sort=sort, limit=limit, dir=dir)
        pprint(api_response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print "Exception when calling ProtocolsApi->list_nfs_exports: %s" % e

There are more examples of coding to the Python PAPI bindings in the
```tests/`` <https://github.com/Isilon/isilon_sdk/tree/master/tests>`__
subdirectory of the repo. The tests currently run against a generic
isi\_sdk import which is how the bindings library is named by default if
you build your own bindings. If you want to run the tests against one of
the libraries you've downloaded from the prebuilt releases page, you
should change the ``import isi_sdk`` lines to ``import isi_sdk_7_2`` or
``import isi_sdk_8_0`` depending on which one you downloaded.
