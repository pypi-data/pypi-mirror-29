= GLOBUS ENDPOINT ACTIVATE(1)

== NAME

globus endpoint activate - Activate an endpoint for use


== SYNOPSIS

*globus endpoint activate* ['OPTIONS'] 'ENDPOINT_ID'


== DESCRIPTION

*globus endpoint activate* activates an endpoint for use by assigning a short
term security credential to that endpoint.

The Globus CLI can activate using Automatic activation, Myproxy activation, 
Delegate Proxy activation, or Web activation. Note that --myproxy --web and
--delegate-proxy are mutually exclusive options as only one activation
method other than autoactivation can be attempted at a time.

Autoactivation will always be attempted unless the --no-autoactivate
option is given. If autoactivation succeeds any other activation options
will be ignored as the endpoint has already been successfully activated.

To use Web activation use the --web option.
The CLI will try to open your default browser to the endpoint's activation
page, but if a remote CLI session is detected, or the --no-browser option
is given, a url will be printed for you to manually follow and activate
the endpoint.

To use Myproxy activation give the --myproxy option.
Myproxy activation requires your username and password for the myproxy
server the endpoint is using for authentication. e.g. for default
Globus Connect Server endpoints this will be your login credentials for the
server the endpoint is hosted on.
You can enter your username when prompted, give your username with the
--myproxy-username option, or set a default myproxy username in config
with "globus config init" or "globus config set
cli.default_myproxy_username".
For security it is recommended that you only enter your password when
prompted to hide your inputs and keep your password out of your command
history, but you may pass your password with the --myproxy-password
or -P options.

NOTE: Delegate Proxy activation requires optional dependencies. You can use
'pip install globus_cli[delegate-proxy]' to include them on install, but
these packages require additional non-python binaries on your machine
before they can be installed via pip. +
For Globus CLI version 1.1.0 M2Crypto is needed. Consult
https://gitlab.com/m2crypto/m2crypto/blob/master/INSTALL.rst[M2Crypto's Install Page]
for installation requirements. +
Globus CLI version 1.1.1 switched to cryptography to be python 3 compatible
and more portable. Consult
https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/[cryptography's Install Page]
for installation requirements.

To use Delegate Proxy activation use the --delegate-proxy option with a
file containing an X.509 certificate as an argument (e.g. an X.509
gotten from the myproxy-logon command). This certificate must
be a valid credential or proxy credential for the user from an identity
provider accepted by the endpoint being activated, and the endpoint must be
configured with a gridmap that will match the globus user using this command
with the local user the certificate was made to. Note if the X.509 is valid,
but the endpoint does not recognize the identity provider or the user
the error will not be detected until the user attempts to perform an operation
on the endpoint.

== OPTIONS

*--web*::                 

Use web activation. Mutually exclusive with --myproxy.

*--no-browser*::

If using --web, Give a url to manually follow instead of opening your default
web browser. Implied if on a remote session.

*--myproxy*::

Use myproxy activation. Mutually exclusive with --web and --delegate-proxy.

*-U, --myproxy-username* TEXT::

Give a username to use with --myproxy skipping the username prompt. 
Overrides any default myproxy username set in config.

*-P, --myproxy-password* TEXT::

WARNING: It is not recommended to use this option as it will leave your 
password in plain-text in your command history.
+
Give a password to use with --myproxy, skipping the password prompt.

NOTE: the --delegate-proxy and --proxy-lifetime options will only appear if
their optional dependencies are available, see the above note on Delegate Proxy
activation for details.

*--delegate-proxy* X.509_PEM_FILE::

Use delegate proxy activation using the credential in the given file.
Credential must be an X.509 in pem format. Mutually exclusive with
--web and --myproxy.

*--proxy-lifetime* INTEGER::

Set a lifetime in hours for the proxy generated by --delegate-proxy.
This sets an upper-bound on the endpoint's activation, but the endpoint may
become deactivated before this lifetime if the certificate used to make the
proxy expires or the credential is revoked.

*--no-autoactivate*::

Don't attempt to autoactivate the endpoint before using another activation
method.

*--force*::

Force activation even if the endpoint is already activated.
