dynamic-group
*************


Description
===========

An dynamic group defines a matching rule. Every bare metal/vm instance
is deployed with an instance certificate. The certificate contains
metadata about the instance. It contains the instance OCID and the
compartment OCID, along with a few other optional properties. When an
API call is made using this instance certificate as the authenticator,
the certificate may be matched to one or multiple dynamic groups.
Depending on policies written against these dynamic groups, the
instance will get access to that API.

This works like regular user/group memebership. But in that case the
membership is a static relationship, whereas in dynamic group, the
membership of an instance certificate to dynamic groups are determined
during runtime.
