        ==============
        
        Django-Webpush is a Package made for integrating and sending `Web Push
        Notification`_ in Django Application. **This is a Work in Progress
        package. As the `Web Push Notification specification`_ is still in
        draft, things may change soon. So keep updated.**
        
        Currently, it Supports Sending Push Notification to **Firefox 46+ and
        Chrome 52+**.
        
        --------------
        
        Installation and Setup
        ----------------------
        
        You can install it easily from pypi by running
        
        ::
        
            pip install django-webpush
        
        After installing the package, add ``webpush`` in in your
        ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings
        
        .. code:: python
        
                INSTALLED_APPS = (
                    ...
                    'webpush',
                )
        
        If you would like to send notification to Google Chrome Users, you need
        to add a ``WEBPUSH_SETTINGS`` entry with the **Vapid Credentials** Like
        following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            WEBPUSH_SETTINGS = {
                "VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY": "Vapid Public Key",
                "VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY":"Vapid Private Key",
                "VAPID_ADMIN_EMAIL": "admin@example.com"
            }
        
        **Replace ``"Vapid Public Key"`` and ``"Vapid Private Key"`` with your
        Vapid Keys. Also replace ``admin@example.com`` with your email so that
        the push server of browser can reach to you if anything goes wrong.**
        
            **To know how to obtain Vapid Keys please see this ```py_vapid```_
            and `Google Developer Documentation`_. You can obtain one easily
            from `web-push-codelab.glitch.me`_. ``Application Server Keys`` and
            ``Vapid Keys`` both are same.**
        
        Then include ``webpush`` in the ``urls.py``
        
        ::
        
            urlpatterns =
        
                url(r'^webpush/', include('webpush.urls'))
            ]
        
        Then run Migration by **``python manage.py migrate``**
        
        Adding Web Push Information in Template
        ---------------------------------------
        
        So in template, you need to load ``webpush_notifications`` custom
        template tag by following: > - If you are using built in templating
        engine, add ``{% load webpush_notifications %}`` in the template > - If
        you are using jinja or other templating engine, you can manually add the
        html header and button and other information. Documentation for them is
        coming soon. Working on getting a automated way for jinja users. If you
        would like to add support for them, patch are very much welcome.
        
        Next, inside the ``<head></head>`` tag add ``{% webpush %}``. Like
        following
        
        ::
        
            <head>
              {% webpush %}
            </head>
        
        Next, inside the ``<body></body>`` tag, insert ``{% webush_button %}``
        where you would like to see the **Subscribe to Push Messaging** Button.
        Like following
        
        ::
        
            <body>
              <p> Hello World! </p>
              {% webpush_button %}
            </body>
        
        ..
        
            **Note:** The Push Notification Button will show only if the user is
            logged in or any ``group`` named is passed through ``webpush``
            context
        
        \***If you would like to mark the subscription as a gr
