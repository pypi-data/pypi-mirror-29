Description: Set IP for network interface
        ============================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is a simple utility to set an IP for a network interface for as long as the utility or a sub-command is running. When it is
        terminated, the IP will be removed from the network interface. This makes a network IP controllable as a service. Tools like
        Nomad can then dynamically enable and disabled IPs where certain services run. If a command is specified, ip-service runs it and
        waits for the program to terminate. The command would ideally provide a network-based service which would be available on the
        specified IP.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The program is intended to be run by the simple command like::
        
          ip-service -a 192.168.0.130
        
        or::
        
          ip-service -a 192.168.0.130 docker start -ai myservice
        
        positional arguments::
          command               command to run (optional)
        
        optional arguments::
          -h, --help                        show help and exit
          --version, -V                     display version and license information
          --log-level / -L LOG_LEVEL        one of {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                                            set log level (default INFO)
          --log-file / -l LOG_FILE
                                            set log file (default: /var/log/ip-service)
          --interface / -i INTERFACE        set network interface (default: the one attached to the default route)
          --ip IP / -a IP                   IP to set (more than one possible)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The software can be installed easily from the Python software repository, either on the command line or by downloading the
        package and installing it explicitly.
        
        .. note::
        
          Python packages should not be installed using *pip* or *easy_install* globally in the system environment under Gentoo Linux.
          There is a carefully crafted system to make system-provided Python scripts available under Python 2 as well as Python 3 which
          is disturbed by packagages deliberately installed by *pip* or *easy_install*. 
        
        Installation using *pip*
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        On the command line, type::
        
          pip install --user jw.ip-service
        
        Explicit Installation from a downloaded package
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Download the package from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jw.ip-service. Unpack it, ``cd`` into the unpacked directory and type the
        command::
        
          python setup.py install --user
