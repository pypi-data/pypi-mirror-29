0.4.0
-----

* Travis apparently still lacks python 3.5 support
* Add python3.5 to travis test
* Add password to tests
* No def password update version
* Revert "Debug CI issue."
* This effectively reverts 40baac6f69e68496d3f615bffddeae0298524c3c, though I am mystified why this is a problem only under Python 3.x
* More CI debug
* Debug CI issue
* Add unit test for new functionality
* Allow support of operations which are not in the default namespace for NETCONF. These end up with a tag of the form "{namespace}localname", and the original logic for finding the handler does not handle this case
* The rpc-reply tag needs to be namespace'd for compatibility with nccclient. This does not break netconf-based clients either and so seems to be the safe thing to do
* Do not assume the message-id is an integer. As per RFC 6241:
* Correct typo: authentication method "passsword" -> "password"
* made backports.socketpair only required and imported on Windows Python < 3.5
* added backports.socketpair to have socket.socketpair() available on Windows Python < 3.5
