NEW FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
########################

I'm trying setting this up as a class instead of a function. Generally I'm not a fan of
functions that return multiple items. If MergedChoiceTable() is a class, then we can
provide access to different properties as needed..

The original function returns three things:
- ID's of the alternatives that were sampled. I don't think this is necessary, because
  you can easily determine it from the merged dataset, right?
- Merged dataset in long format. This is the key output.
- 2D binary matrix representing chosen alternatives. This is the format expected by the
  MNL estimation function, but it could also be provided as a named column in the merged
  dataset.

There may be other properties we'll want for PyLogit compatibility, too.

"""

class MergedChoiceTable(object):
    """
    Generates a merged long-format table of choosers and alternatives, for discrete choice
    model estimation or simulation. 
    
    Attributes that vary based on interaction between the choosers and alternatives 
    (distance, for example) will need to be added in post-processing. 
    
    Reserved column names: 'chosen', 'join_index', 'observation_id'.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    observations : pandas.DataFrame
        Table with one row for each choice scenario, with unique ID's in the index field.
        Additional columns can contain fixed attributes of the choosers. Best not to have
        a column with the same name as the index field of the 'alternatives' table,
        because these will clash when the tables are merged. (If you have one, it will be
        used to identify chosen alternatives if needed, and then dropped.)
        [TO DO: check that this is handled correctly.]

    alternatives : pandas.DataFrame
        Table with one row for each alternative, with unique ID's in the index field.
        Additional columns can contain fixed attributes of the alternatives.

    chosen_alternatives : str or list or pandas.Series, optional
        List of the alternative ID selected in each choice scenario. (This is required for
        preparing estimation data, but not for simulation data.) If str, interpreted as a
        column name from the observations table. If list, must be in the same order as the
        observations. The column will be dropped from the merged table and replaced with a
        binary column named 'chosen'.

    sample_size : int, optional
        Number of alternatives available for each chooser. These will be sampled randomly.
        If 'None', all of the alternatives will be available for each chooser.

    sample_weights : ???, optional
        Not yet implemented. The weights could either be alternative-specific,
        (len = alts) or could vary for different choosers (len = alts x choosers). So we
        might want to accept either (a) a column of the alternatives table, (b) a separate
        lookup table, or (c) a function that returns weights.
