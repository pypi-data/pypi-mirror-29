Part of the Metrasynth_ project.

.. _Metrasynth: https://metrasynth.github.io/

Radiant Voices provides tools to
**create, read, modify, and write SunVox files**.
This includes project files ending in ``.sunvox``,
and module/synth files ending in ``.sunsynth``.

SunVox data structures and APIs
-------------------------------

Radiant Voices has nearly 100% coverage of
all data structures used by SunVox files,
exposing a "Pythonic" API for creating and manipulating
those structures.

Using the API, you can do things not possible
with the standard SunVox interface or the SunVox DLL, such as:

- `algorithmic composition`_
- parametric synth/module design
- structure and complexity analysis
- automatic `graph layout`_ of modules
- and more...

Our collective imagination is the limit!

Interaction with the SunVox DLL
-------------------------------

By combining Radiant Voices with sunvox-dll-python_,
one can also create alternative editing and performance tools
to use alongside, or instead of, the official SunVox app.

The two packages work together to provide convenient high-level
APIs for loading project and module objects directly into
playback slots managed by the SunVox DLL.

Some possibilities might include:

- alternative project editors
- generative_ sound design using `genetic algorithms`_
- network-enabled performance tools

What can *you* come up with?

SunVox file format documentation
--------------------------------

Radiant Voices intends to serve as a *de facto* source of documentation
about the format, as there is currently `no official documentation for the
SunVox file format <http://www.warmplace.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1943#p5562>`__.

The interpretation of SunVox file formats is based on a mix of "clean room"
style inspection of what SunVox writes to disk when a file is edited
a specific way, as well as the `most recent BSD-licensed source code
for the SunVox audio engine <https://github.com/warmplace/sunvox_sources>`__.


Requirements
------------

- Python 3.6

- OS supported by `sunvox-dll-python`_, if working with SunVox DLL.


Quick start
-----------

The "hello world" example will construct a SunVox project in memory
containing a FM module connected to the Output module.
It will then load it into the SunVox DLL and send a single note-on command
to the FM module::

    $ pip install radiant-voices
    $ git clone https://github.com/metrasynth/radiant-voices
    $ cd radiant-voices/examples
    $ python helloworld.py


About SunVox
------------

From the `SunVox home page`_:

    SunVox is a small, fast and powerful modular synthesizer with pattern-based sequencer (tracker).
    It is a tool for those people who like to compose music wherever they are, whenever they wish.
    On any device. SunVox is available for Windows, OS X, Linux, Maemo, Meego, Raspberry Pi,
    Windows Mobile (WindowsCE), PalmOS, iOS and Android.
