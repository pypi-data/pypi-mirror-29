"""
The module ``prof`` provides support tracing and profiling.

===============================================================================
Overview
===============================================================================
The module ``prof`` provides a few primitives for tracing function calls and
memory usage. In particular, it provides a trace logger that gives us feedback
about arguments passed, the run time, the exception raised, etc. Decorators are
available for wrapping functions and classes (all methods). In addition to the
trace logger, a memory profiler is also provided, which can be run in a
separate thread to get information about memory usage. The memory profiler
requires |psutil|_.
