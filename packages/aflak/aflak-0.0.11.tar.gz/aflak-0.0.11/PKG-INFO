           :alt: Build status
        
        **IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: Features and API highly unstable!**
        
        Environment
        ===========
        
        Support Python3.5+.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        You can install `aflak` using any of the following methods.
        
        Using pip
        ---------
        
        This is the recommended way of installing aflak as a user. Please make sure
        to install `aflak` for python 3.x. It will not work on python 2.x.
        
        .. code :: bash
        
            pip install aflak  # pip should point to python3!
            pip3 install aflak # Use `pip3' if you are on Debian or Ubuntu
        
        
        Depending on your python install, you should be able to run aflak form the
        command line with any of these commands
        
        .. code :: bash
        
            aflak            # This should work in most environment
            python -m aflak  # `python' should be the python 3.x interpreter!
            python3 -m aflak
        
        Using .deb files
        ----------------
        
        *Only `Debian Stretch` and `Ubuntu 17.10` are supported for now.*
        
        Download the .deb file of the latest release from
        https://github.com/malikolivier/aflak/releases
        
        Install it with:
        
        .. code :: bash
        
            sudo dpkg -i aflak-X.X.X-release.deb
            # If dependencies are missing, you should then run:
            sudo apt-get install -f
        
        Remove it with:
        
        .. code :: bash
        
            sudo apt-get remove aflak
        
        From source locally
        -------------------
        
        .. code :: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/malikolivier/aflak
            cd aflak
            virtualenv -p python3 venv
            . ./venv/bin/activate
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ./run
        
        Open a FITS file
        ================
        
        ::
        
            aflak my-fits-file.fits
        
        The provided FITS file is required to have the following extensions:
        
        - 'FLUX': 3D data containing 2D luminosity component for each wavelength value
        - 'WAVE': 1D data containing value of each target wavelength
        
        After some fiddling you should be able to get a window like below:
        
        .. figure:: images/2017-11-13-screenshot.jpg?raw=true
           :alt: Screen capture of the running GUI application
        
        Get sample FITS files
        =====================
        
        The Makefile contains a few recipes to get sample fits files.
        Run make as below:
        
        ::
        
            make data/manga-7443-12703-LINCUBE.fits
        
        To see a fits file header
        =========================
        
        ::
        
            fold -w 80 foo.fits | less
        
        TODO

        -  Show arbitrary sums over spectral data (currently only show one frame)
        -  Benchmark / Test with several fits files
        -  Set a label on the histogram's Y-axis (flux [1E-17 erg/s/cm^2])
