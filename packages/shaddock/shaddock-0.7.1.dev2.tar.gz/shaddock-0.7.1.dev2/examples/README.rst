Examples
-------------
Shaddock includes many tests to demonstrate the use of Shaddock. All of the 
tests are in the 'tests' folder. It can be used as a starting point for new 
projects. The tests also serve as SHDK docs.

Please look in the tests folder for examples of how to define yaml files for use
with SHDK. Most of the test examples are snippets of yaml, for a more complete
example look at the tests in the 'tests/model' folder.


OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~~
https://github.com/epheo/shaddock-openstack.git is a yml definition model
example you can use with Shaddock to build, deploy and manage the lifecycle of
an OpenStack platform from the upstream git sources.
