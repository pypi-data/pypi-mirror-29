        Core loss modelling framework.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        -----
        Linux
        -----
        
        * **Debian**: g++ compiler build-essential, libtool, zlib1g-dev autoconf on debian distros
        * **Red Hat**: 'Development Tools' and zlib-devel
        
        -------
        Windows
        -------
        
        Cygwin 64-bit is required for the Windows native build.  Cygwin is a Linux environment running in Windows.
        http://www.cygwin.com/
        
        Download and run the set-up program for Cygwin.
        The following Cygwin add-in packages are required;
        
        * gcc-g++
        * gcc-core
        * make
        * diffutils
        * automake
        * libtools
        * zlib-devel
        * git
        
        
        To build native Windows 64-bit executables;
        
        * mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++
        * mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core
        * mingw64-x86_64-zlib
        
        Search for 'mingw', gcc', 'make' and 'diffutils' to find all of the relevant packages (Only 'gcc' illustrated below).

        Install With Pip
        ----------------
        
        The latest released version of the package can be installed using pip
        by running::
        
            pip install oasislmf
        
        Alternatively you can install the latest development version using::
        
            pip install -s git+https://git@github.com/OasisLMF/OasisLMF
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Dependencies are controlled by ``pip-tools``. To install the development dependencies
        first, install ``pip-tools`` using::
        
            pip install pip-tools
        
        and run::
        
            pip-sync
        
        To add new dependencies to the development requirements add the package name to ``requirements.in`` or
        to add a new dependency to the installed package add the package name to ``requirements-package.in``.
        Version specifiers can be supplied to the packages but these should be kept as loose as possible so that
        all packages can be easily updated and there will be fewer conflict when installing.
        
        After adding packages to either ``*.in`` file::
        
            pip-compile && pip-sync
        
        should be ran ensuring the development dependencies are kept up to
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To test the code style run::
        
            flake8
        
        To test against all supported python versions run::
        
            tox
        
        To test against your currently installed version of python run::
        
            py.test
        
        To run the full test suite run::
        
            ./runtests.sh
