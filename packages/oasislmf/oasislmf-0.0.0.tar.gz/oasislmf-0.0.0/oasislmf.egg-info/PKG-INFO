        ========
        
        Core loss modelling framework.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Dependencies are controlled by ``pip-tools``. To install the development dependencies
        first, install ``pip-tools`` using::
        
            pip install pip-tools
        
        and run::
        
            pip-sync
        
        To add new dependencies to the development requirements add the package name to ``requirements.in`` or
        to add a new dependency to the installed package add the package name to ``requirements-package.in``.
        Version specifiers can be supplied to the packages but these should be kept as loose as possible so that
        all packages can be easily updated and there will be fewer conflict when installing.
        
        After adding packages to either ``*.in`` file::
        
            pip-compile && pip-sync
        
        should be ran ensuring the development dependencies are kept up to
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        To test the code style run::
        
            flake8
        
        To test against all supported python versions run::
        
            tox
        
        To test against your currently installed version of python run::
        
            py.test
        
        To run the full test suite run::
        
            ./runtests.sh
