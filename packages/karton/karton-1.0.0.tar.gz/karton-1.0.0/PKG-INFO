Description: Karton is a tool which can transparently run Linux programs on macOS,
        a different Linux distro, or a different architecture.
        To do this, you just need to tell Karton which distro to use, which
        packages to install, and which directories to make accessible. This is
        called an image.
        
        Then you can run your commands inside the image just by adding
        "karton run image-name" in front of your commands.
        
        Underneath, Karton uses Docker to allow running programs and manage
        semi-persistent containers.
