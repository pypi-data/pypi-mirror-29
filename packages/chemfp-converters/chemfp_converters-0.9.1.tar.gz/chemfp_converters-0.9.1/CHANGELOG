What's new in 0.9.1 (In development)
====================================

The distribution now uses setuptools. The command-line programs
are installed using the "console_scripts" entry_point.

Improvements to the flush reader and writer so they can be used from
chemfp if the chemfp_converters package is install. The changes are:

  - flush.open_flush() now takes a 'location' so chemfp.open() can
  pass in the location passed to it.

  - flush.open_fingerprint_writer() now allows metadata=None. In that
  case it will wait until the first fingerprint is passed in to get
  the fingerprint size.

Everything. This is the first release.
