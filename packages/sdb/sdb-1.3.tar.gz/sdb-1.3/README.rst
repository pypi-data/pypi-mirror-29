Sdb
===
A socket-based remote debugger for Python.  Based on `celery.contrib.rdb`.

Usage
-----

Use the `sdb` library to set remote breakpoints in any non-interactive or
background Python code and debug interactively over a telnet session::

   # some/python/code.py

   class SomeCode(object):

       def run(self, **kwargs):
           # This will set a breakpoint and open an interactive Python
           # debugger exposed on a random port between 6899-6999.  The chosen
           # port will be reported as a warning
           #
           # Remote Debugger:6900: Please telnet into 0.0.0.0 6900.
           #
           # You can access it from your host machine using telnet:
           #
           # $ telnet <hostname> <port>
           import sdb
           sdb.set_trace()

Keep in mind that when you interactively debug in this way, any process
that encounters a breakpoint will wait until an active client is established
and concludes the debugging session with a `continue` command.

Automatically Connecting to Breakpoints
---------------------------------------

To simplify remote debugging session management, you can use `sdb-listen`
to automatically discover open remote debugging sessions and connect to them::

   $ sdb-listen

This will open a Python process that listens for new debugger sessions and
automatically connects to them for you.  If your breakpoint is run on
an _entirely different host_, you can optionally specify the hostname where
`rbd-listen` is running::

   import sdb
   sdb.set_trace(notify_host='docker.for.mac.localhost')
