Summary: Python package for dealing with whole slide images (.svs) for machine learning, including
                intuitive, painless patch sampling using OpenSlide, automatic labeling from ImageScope XML 
                annotation files, and functions for saving these patches and their meta data into lightning
                memory-mapped databases (LMDB) for quick reads.

Description: py-wsi
        ======
        
        These Python functions deal with whole slide images (WSI), or Aperio
        .svs files for deep learning, using OpenSlide. py-wsi provides functions
        to perform patch sampling from .svs files, generation of metadata, and
        several store options: saving to a lightning memory-mapped database
        (LMDB), HDF5 files, or disk.
        
        Lim et al. in “`An analysis of image storage systems for scalable
        training of deep neural
        networks <http://www.bafst.com/events/asplos16/bpoe7/wp-content/uploads/analysis-image-storage.pdf>`__”
        perform a thorough evaluation of the best image storage systems, taking
        into consideration memory usage and access speed. LMDB, a B+tree based
        key-value storage, is not the most memory efficient, but provides
        optimal read time.
        
        py-wsi uses OpenSlide Python. According to the `Python OpenSlide
        website <http://openslide.org/api/python/>`__, “OpenSlide is a C library
        that provides a simple interface for reading whole-slide images, also
        known as virtual slides, which are high-resolution images used in
        digital pathology. These images can occupy tens of gigabytes when
        uncompressed, and so cannot be easily read using standard tools or
        libraries, which are designed for images that can be comfortably
        uncompressed into RAM. Whole-slide images are typically
        multi-resolution; OpenSlide allows reading a small amount of image data
        at the resolution closest to a desired zoom level.”
        
        *Note: HDF5 functionality is currently on hold.*

        Setup
        -----
        
        This library is dependent on the following, (also included in
        requirements.txt) but may be compatible
        
        python 3.6.1 numpy 1.12.1 openslide-python 1.1.1
        
        1. Check dependencies listed in setup.py; notably, openslide-python
           which requires openslide, and lmdb.
        
        ::
        
            brew install openslide
        
        2. Install py_wsi using pip.
        
        ::
        
            pip install py_wsi
        
        3. Check out Jupyter Notebook “Using py-wsi” to see what py-wsi can do
           and get started!
