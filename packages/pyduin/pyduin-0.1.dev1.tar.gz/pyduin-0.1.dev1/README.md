# python-arduino (unreleased)

## What?

A pyhton wrapper for arduino. It consists of two parts

* A python library for arduino, pin, pinmode 
* An arduino firmware

## What for?

To interact seamless with an arduino from within python. Once an arduino has the correct firmware applied, one can set pin modes, pin states, pwm values and more.

## Is it usable?

Yes it is. But it is neither packaged nor well documented. Working on a release.
