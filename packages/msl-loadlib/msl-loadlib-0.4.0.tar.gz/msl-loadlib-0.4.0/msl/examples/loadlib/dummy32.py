"""
A *dummy* example of a 32-bit server.

Example of a server that is executed by a 32-bit Python interpreter that receives
requests from the corresponding :mod:`~.dummy64` module which can be run by a 64-bit
Python interpreter.

:class:`~.dummy32.Dummy32` is the 32-bit server class and :class:`~.dummy64.Dummy64` is
the 64-bit client class. These *dummy* classes do not actually communicate with a shared
library. The point of these *dummy* classes is to show that a Python data type in a
64-bit process appears as the same data type in the 32-bit process and vice versa.

class Dummy32(Server32):
    """
    Example of a server class that illustrates that Python data types are preserved
    when they are sent from the :class:`~.dummy64.Dummy64` client to the server.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host : :obj:`str`
        The IP address of the server.
    port : :obj:`int`
        The port to open on the server.
    quiet : :obj:`bool`
        Whether to hide :obj:`sys.stdout` messages from the server.

    Note
    ----
    Any class that is a subclass of :class:`~msl.loadlib.server32.Server32` **MUST**
    provide three arguments in its constructor: `host`, `port` and `quiet`
    (in that order) and `**kwargs`. Otherwise the ``server32`` executable, see
    :class:`~msl.loadlib.start_server32`, cannot create an instance of the
    :class:`~msl.loadlib.server32.Server32` subclass.
