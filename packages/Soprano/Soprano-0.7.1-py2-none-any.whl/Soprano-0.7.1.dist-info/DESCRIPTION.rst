Soprano is a Python library developed and maintained by the CCP for NMR
Crystallography as a tool to help scientists working with crystallography and
simulations to generate, manipulate, run calculations on and analyse large
data sets of crystal structures, with a particular attention to the output of
ab-initio random structure searching,
or AIRSS. (https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/Codes/AIRSS)

It provides a number of functionalities to help automate many common tasks
in computational crystallography.
