# Chaos Toolkit Extension for AWS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-aws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-aws)
[![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/chaostoolkit-aws.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This project is a collection of [actions][] and [probes][], gathered as an
extension to the [Chaos Toolkit][chaostoolkit].

[actions]: http://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/#action
[probes]: http://chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/#probe
[chaostoolkit]: http://chaostoolkit.org

## Install

This package requires Python 3.5+

To be used from your experiment, this package must be installed in the Python
environment where [chaostoolkit][] already lives.

```
$ pip install -U chaostoolkit-aws
```

## Usage

To use the probes and actions from this package, add the following to your
experiment file:

```json
{
    "name": "stop-an-ec2-instance",
    "provider": {
        "type": "python",
        "module": "chaosaws.ec2.actions",
        "func": "stop_instance",
        "arguments": {
            "instance_id": "i-123456"
        }
    }
}
```

That's it!

Please explore the code to see existing probes and actions.

## Configuration

### Credentials

This extension uses the [boto3][] library under the hood. This library expects
that you have properly [configured][creds] your environment to connect and
authenticate with the AWS services.

[boto3]: https://boto3.readthedocs.io
[creds]: https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html

Generally speaking, there are two ways of doing this:

* you have [configured][creds] the environment where you will run the
  experiment from (so either with a `~/.aws/credentials` or proper environment
  variables)
* you explicitely pass the correct environment variables to the experiment
  definition as follows:

    ```json
    {
        "secrets": {
            "aws": {
                "aws_access_key_id": "your key",
                "aws_secret_access_key": "access key",
                "aws_session_token": "token",
            }
        }
    }
    ```

  Note that the token is optional.

  Then, use it as follows:


    ```json
    {
        "name": "stop-an-ec2-instance",
        "provider": {
            "type": "python",
            "module": "chaosaws.ec2.actions",
            "func": "stop_instance",
            "secrets": ["aws"],
            "arguments": {
                "instance_id": "i-123456"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Other AWS settings

In additon to the authentication credentials, you can configure the region
against which you want to use. At the top level of the experiment, add:

```json
{
    "configuration": {
        "aws_region": "us-east-1"
    }
}
```

## Contribute

If you wish to contribute more functions to this package, you are more than
welcome to do so. Please, fork this project, make your changes following the
usual [PEP 8][pep8] code style, sprinkling with tests and submit a PR for
review.

[pep8]: https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The Chaos Toolkit projects require all contributors must sign a
[Developer Certificate of Origin][dco] on each commit they would like to merge
into the master branch of the repository. Please, make sure you can abide by
the rules of the DCO before submitting a PR.

### Develop

If you wish to develop on this project, make sure to install the development
dependencies. But first, [create a virtual environment][venv] and then install
those dependencies.

[venv]: http://chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/install/#create-a-virtual-environment

```console
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements.txt 
```

Then, point your environment to this directory:

```console
$ python setup.py develop
```

Now, you can edit the files and they will be automatically be seen by your
environment, even when running from the `chaos` command locally.

### Test

To run the tests for the project execute the following:

```
$ pytest
```
