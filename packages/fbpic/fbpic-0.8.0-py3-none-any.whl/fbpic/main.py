        - the `Fields` object, which contains the field data on the grids
        - a set of electrons
        - a set of ions (if initialize_ions is True)

        Parameters
        ----------
        Nz: int
            The number of gridpoints along z
        Nr: int
            The number of gridpoints along r

        zmax: float
            The position of the edge of the simulation in z
            (More precisely, the position of the edge of the last cell)
        rmax: float
            The position of the edge of the simulation in r
            (More precisely, the position of the edge of the last
            cell)

        Nm: int
            The number of azimuthal modes taken into account. (The simulation
            uses the modes from `m=0` to `m=(Nm-1)`.)

        dt: float
            The timestep of the simulation

        p_zmin: float
            The minimal z position above which the particles are initialized
        p_zmax: float
            The maximal z position below which the particles are initialized
        p_rmin: float
            The minimal r position above which the particles are initialized
        p_rmax: float
            The maximal r position below which the particles are initialized

        p_nz: int
            The number of macroparticles per cell along the z direction
        p_nr: int
            The number of macroparticles per cell along the r direction
        p_nt: int
            The number of macroparticles along the theta direction

        n_e: float (in particles per m^3)
           Peak density of the electrons

        n_order: int, optional
           The order of the stencil for z derivatives in the Maxwell solver.
           Use -1 for infinite order, i.e. for exact dispersion relation in
           all direction (adviced for single-GPU/single-CPU simulation).
           Use a positive number (and multiple of 2) for a finite-order stencil
           (required for multi-GPU/multi-CPU with MPI). A large `n_order` leads
           to more overhead in MPI communications, but also to a more accurate
           dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves. (Typically,
           `n_order = 32` is a good trade-off.) See `this article
           <https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05712>`_ for more information.

        zmin: float, optional
           The position of the edge of the simulation box.
           (More precisely, the position of the edge of the first cell)

        dens_func: callable, optional
           A function of the form:
           def dens_func( z, r ) ...
           where z and r are 1d arrays, and which returns
           a 1d array containing the density *relative to n*
           (i.e. a number between 0 and 1) at the given positions

        initialize_ions: bool, optional
           Whether to initialize the neutralizing ions
        filter_currents: bool, optional
            Whether to filter the currents and charge in k space

        v_comoving: float or None, optional
            If this variable is None, the standard PSATD is used (default).
            Otherwise, the current is assumed to be "comoving",
            i.e. constant with respect to (z - v_comoving * t).
            This can be done in two ways: either by
            - Using a PSATD scheme that takes this hypothesis into account
            - Solving the PSATD scheme in a Galilean frame
        use_galilean: bool, optional
            Determines which one of the two above schemes is used
            When use_galilean is true, the whole grid moves
            with a speed v_comoving

        use_cuda: bool, optional
            Wether to use CUDA (GPU) acceleration

        n_guard: int, optional
            Number of guard cells to use at the left and right of
            a domain, when performing parallel (MPI) computation
            or when using open boundaries. Defaults to None, which
            calculates the required guard cells for n_order
            automatically (approx 2*n_order). If no MPI is used and
            in the case of open boundaries with an infinite order stencil,
            n_guard defaults to 30, if not set otherwise.
        n_damp : int, optional
            Number of damping guard cells at the left and right of a
            simulation box if a moving window is attached. The guard
            region at these areas (left / right of moving window) is
            extended by n_damp (N=n_guard+n_damp) in order to smoothly
            damp the fields such that they do not wrap around.
            (Defaults to 30)
        exchange_period: int, optional
            Number of iterations before which the particles are exchanged.
            If set to None, the maximum exchange period is calculated
            automatically: Within exchange_period timesteps, the
            particles should never be able to travel more than
            (n_guard - particle_shape order) cells. (Setting exchange_period
            to small values can substantially affect the performance)

        boundaries: string, optional
            Indicates how to exchange the fields at the left and right
            boundaries of the global simulation box.
            Either 'periodic' or 'open'

        gamma_boost : float, optional
            When initializing the laser in a boosted frame, set the
            value of `gamma_boost` to the corresponding Lorentz factor.
            All the other quantities (zmin, zmax, n_e, etc.) are to be given
            in the lab frame.

        use_all_mpi_ranks: bool, optional
            When launching the simulation with mpirun:

            - if `use_all_mpi_ranks` is True (default):
              All the MPI ranks will contribute to the same simulation,
              using domain-decomposition to share the work.
            - if `use_all_mpi_ranks` is False:
              Each MPI rank will run an independent simulation.
              This can be useful when running parameter scans. In this case,
              make sure that your input script is written so that the input
              parameters and output folder depend on the MPI rank.

        particle_shape: str, optional
            Set the particle shape for the charge/current deposition.
            Possible values are 'cubic', 'linear'. ('cubic' corresponds to
            third order shapes and 'linear' to first order shapes).

        verbose_level: int, optional
            Print information about the simulation setup after
            initialization of the Simulation class.
            0 - Print no information
            1 (Default) - Print basic information
            2 - Print detailed information
