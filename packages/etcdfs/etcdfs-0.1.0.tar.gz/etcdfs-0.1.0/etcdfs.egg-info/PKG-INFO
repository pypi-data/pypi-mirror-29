        etcdfs: Filesystem based on etcd
        ================================
        
        About
        -----
        
        ``etcdfs`` is a simple FUSE filesystem based on etcd. It allows you to mount the
        key space of an etcd cluster as a filesystem.
        
        The main goal of this project is to be able to work with etcd with well-known
        Linux tools, like ``ls``, ``cp``, ``grep``, rather than ``etcdctl`` or any
        other etcd command-line client.
        
        ``etcdfs`` can also be useful in case a very simple shared storage is required,
        like in the case of common configuration.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        ``etcdfs`` can mount the whole etcd hierarchical key space (``/``) or any part
        of it. Etcd keys are mapped to FS files and etcd directories are mapped to FS
        directories.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First you will need to install FUSE from http://github.com/libfuse/libfuse.
        After installing FUSE, install the ``etcdfs`` Python package:
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        How to use
        ----------
        
        Simply run ``etcdfs`` and provide the mountpoint and the etcd keyspace that
        you want to mount:
        
        	$ etcdfs --basedir $basedir $mountpoint
        
        Unmount the filesystem by using ``fusermount``:
        
            $ fusermount -u $mountpoint
