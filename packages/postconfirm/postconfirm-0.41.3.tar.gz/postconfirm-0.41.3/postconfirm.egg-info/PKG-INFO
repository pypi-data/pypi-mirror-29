        Caution
        -------
        
        This is an alpha release.  While the functionality is sound, the
        packaging is probably not even beta quality.  Compilation of the
        components written in C has only been tested under Linux.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        postconfirm consists of postconfirmd, which is the long-running
        (daemon) part, and postconfirmc, which is the client part of a
        client-server program which handles email confirmations. It is
        intended as a front-end to mailing lists. It provides
        funcitonality which is a subset of TMDA, but is adapted to
        high-volume usage and does not have anywhere near all the bells
        and whistles which TMDA has. On the other hand, since the
        whitelist lookup is done by the long-running server part, the
        overhead of doing a verification that a poster has a confirmed
        address is much smaller than for TMDA.  This makes it a factor
        1000 or more faster than TMDA in production, with a memory footprint
        a factor 20 smaller.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 0.41.3 (21 Feb 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added warnings on failure for some post-install actions.
        
          * Changed the interface to accept multiple recipients when given on the
            command line (for use with dmarc-rewrite).  Changed dmarc-rewrite to
            accept multiple recipients, and renamed the recipient argument for other
            functions that can accept recipient lists.  
        
          * Changed the -e argument to log arguments to syslog and not exit.
        
          * Reverted an earlier change of socket ownership handling.
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.41.2 (16 Feb 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added and --echo argument to echo back sys.argv.  Rewrote the logic to 
            find sender and recipient, in order to not throw out SENDER and RECIPIENT 
            in environment when they are set to nothing, which in some circumstances 
            can be valid.
        
          * Don't enforce uid and gid  on socket in foreground mode, to make 
            testing easier.
        
          * Corrected the trove classifier for development status.
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.41.1 (15 Feb 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Changed default dmarc-rewrite %-encoding character from '%' to '=', and 
            made it configurable.
