        Caution
        -------
        
        This is an alpha release.  While the functionality is sound, the
        packaging is probably not even beta quality.  Compilation of the
        components written in C has only been tested under Linux.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        postconfirm consists of postconfirmd, which is the long-running
        (daemon) part, and postconfirmc, which is the client part of a
        client-server program which handles email confirmations. It is
        intended as a front-end to mailing lists. It provides
        funcitonality which is a subset of TMDA, but is adapted to
        high-volume usage and does not have anywhere near all the bells
        and whistles which TMDA has. On the other hand, since the
        whitelist lookup is done by the long-running server part, the
        overhead of doing a verification that a poster has a confirmed
        address is much smaller than for TMDA.  This makes it a factor
        1000 or more faster than TMDA in production, with a memory footprint
        a factor 20 smaller.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 0.40 (20 Jan 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added checking of the mailman list archive flag before adding the
            Archived-At: header field.
        
          * Added a mailman_dir config option, in order to be able to import
            the python mailman libs even if not on the regular python path.
        
          * Fixed the -s / --socket option, to make it take an argument as intended.
        
          * Changed the handling of sys.stdout and sys.stderr when running in foreground
            mode -- they should not go to syslog in that case.
        
          * Added reading of mailman listinfo for all mailman lists on startup and
            on receipt of SIGHUP.
