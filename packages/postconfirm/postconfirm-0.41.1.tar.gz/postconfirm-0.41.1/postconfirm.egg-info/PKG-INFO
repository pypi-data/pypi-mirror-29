        Caution
        -------
        
        This is an alpha release.  While the functionality is sound, the
        packaging is probably not even beta quality.  Compilation of the
        components written in C has only been tested under Linux.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        postconfirm consists of postconfirmd, which is the long-running
        (daemon) part, and postconfirmc, which is the client part of a
        client-server program which handles email confirmations. It is
        intended as a front-end to mailing lists. It provides
        funcitonality which is a subset of TMDA, but is adapted to
        high-volume usage and does not have anywhere near all the bells
        and whistles which TMDA has. On the other hand, since the
        whitelist lookup is done by the long-running server part, the
        overhead of doing a verification that a poster has a confirmed
        address is much smaller than for TMDA.  This makes it a factor
        1000 or more faster than TMDA in production, with a memory footprint
        a factor 20 smaller.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 0.41.1 (15 Feb 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Changed default dmarc-rewrite %-encoding character from '%' to '=', and 
            made it configurable.
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.41.0 (14 Feb 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This the first release uploaded to pypi.python.org, for more standardised
          installation using pip.  It's still not expected to be ready for beta use,
          but installation on the IETF servers should be easier this way.
        
          The essensial feature of this release is the ability to do experimental
          dmarc rewrites, both for outgoing mailman list messages, and to handle
          replies coming in to the rewritten addresses.  From the commit log:
        
          * Added dmarc rewrite functionality to postconfirmd.  Also various 
            accumulated tweaks and changes.
        
          * Refined setup, in preparation for alpha release to pypi.
        
          * README updated to indicate that this is an alpha release.
        
          * Refined mailman interface wrapper, with conditional filter actions.
        
          * Added some new config defaults.  Fixed an issue with the help display.  
            Updated imports.  Added chown for the socket.
        
          * Refactored service.py to permit multiple actions.  Added option 
            parsing.  Added bounce handling, but commented out.  Added dmarc handling.  
            Added comprehensive docstring for --help messages.
        
          * Updated the docstring.  Added default config for dmarc.
        
          * Tweaked sockserver output to straghten multiple lines into one.
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.40 (20 Jan 2017)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added checking of the mailman list archive flag before adding the
            Archived-At: header field.
        
          * Added a mailman_dir config option, in order to be able to import
            the python mailman libs even if not on the regular python path.
        
          * Fixed the -s / --socket option, to make it take an argument as intended.
        
          * Changed the handling of sys.stdout and sys.stderr when running in foreground
            mode -- they should not go to syslog in that case.
        
          * Added reading of mailman listinfo for all mailman lists on startup and
            on receipt of SIGHUP.
