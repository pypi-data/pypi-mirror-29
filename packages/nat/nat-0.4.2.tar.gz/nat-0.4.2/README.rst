NeuroAnnotation Toolbox (NAT)
=============================

Python module to use the annotations created with
`NeuroCurator <https://github.com/BlueBrain/neurocurator>`__, for
example in a `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__ notebook.

This framework has been described in details in the following
open-access paper: https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2017.00027.

NAT provides the necessary functions and utilities to: - reliably
annotate the neuroscientific literature, - curate published values for
modeling parameters, - save them in reusable corpora.

Releases
--------

Versions and their notable changes are listed in the `releases
section <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nat/releases/>`__.

Releases are synchronized with the ones of NeuroCurator.

Status
------

Created during 2016.

Ongoing stabilization and reengineering in the branch
*refactor-architecture*.

The branch *refactor-architecture* is **not** intended to be used by
end-users.

New features, bug fixes and improvements are done on the reengineered
code sections.

When a reengineered code section is stable, itâ€™s merged into the branch
*master* and a release is published.
