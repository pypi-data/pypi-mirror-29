    Introducing delayed methods
    ===========================

    A delayed method is a smart method that detects in what environment is invoked
    and avoid duplicated and expensive calls.

    In transactional-free context, a delayed method behaves like normal a method:
    do his work and returns.

    Meanwhile, in the context of any open transaction or undo/redo operation, a
    delayed method enqueues the call, avoiding duplicates for the end of the
    transactional operation.

    That results in reduction of redundant calls done, for example while deleting
    a big set of elements at once.

    Creating a delayed method with a decorator is elegant and simple: nothing
    changes from the user point of view.

    The main target of delayed methods is obviously graphical updates, but surprisingly
    the origin of this idea was to minimice code regeneration.
