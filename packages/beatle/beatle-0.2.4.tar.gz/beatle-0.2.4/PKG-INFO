Description: 
        This work was started many years ago in my head, while I learned a useful UML approach.
        I hope this application may be useful for the few people that today still believe in 
        that the  software creation is not only a work, but an exciting field of investigation. 
        
        Beatle is full of small things you can profit or improve, if you want: transactionality decorators,
        dynamic code generation, delayed methods, pyboost automated interfaces ...
        
        I plan to include web service design, node-js support, distributed web interface,  
        and many other things you can use for speedup development.
        
        At least, I will be happy if you enjoy using this environment and contribute if you want.
