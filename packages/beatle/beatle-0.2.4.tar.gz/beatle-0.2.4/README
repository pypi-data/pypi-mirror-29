This work was started many years ago in my head, while I learned a useful UML approach.
I hope this application may be useful for the few people that today still believe in 
that the  software creation is not only a work, but an exciting field of investigation. 

Beatle is full of small things you can profit or improve, if you want: transactionality decorators,
dynamic code generation, delayed methods, pyboost automated interfaces ...

I plan to include web service design, node-js support, distributed web interface,  
and many other things you can use for speedup development.

At least, I will be happy if you enjoy using this environment and contribute if you want.
