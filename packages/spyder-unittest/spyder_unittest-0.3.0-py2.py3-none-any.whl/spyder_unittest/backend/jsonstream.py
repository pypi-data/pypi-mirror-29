Reader and writer for sending stream of python objects using JSON.

These classes can be used to send Python objects (specifically, ints, floats,
strings, bools, lists, dictionaries or None) over a text stream. Partially
received objects are correctly handled.

Since multiple JSON-encoded objects cannot simply concatenated (i.e., JSON is
not a framed protocol), every object is sent over the text channel in the
format "N \n s \n", where the string s is its JSON encoding and N is the length
of s.
