This is a plugin for the Spyder IDE that integrates popular unit test
frameworks. It allows you to run tests and view the results.

**Status:**
This is a work in progress. It is useable, but only the basic functionality
is implemented at the moment. The plugin currently supports the py.test and nose
testing frameworks.
