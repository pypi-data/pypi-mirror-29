The awesome-pages plugin allows you to customize how your pages show up the navigation of your MkDocs without having to configure the full structure in your ``mkdocs.yml``. It extracts the title from your markdown files and gives you detailed control using a small configuration file directly placed in the relevant directory of your documentation. See `Github <https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin>`_ or the README.md for more details.
