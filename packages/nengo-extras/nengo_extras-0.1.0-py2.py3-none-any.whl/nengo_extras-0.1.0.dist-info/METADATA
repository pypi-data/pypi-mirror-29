Nengo extras
************

Extra utilities and add-ons for Nengo.

This repository contains utilities that occupy
a liminal space not quite generic enough for inclusion in Nengo_,
but useful enough that they should be publicly accessible.

Some of these utilities may eventually migrate to Nengo_,
and others may be split off into their own separate repositories.
