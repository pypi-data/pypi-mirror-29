GWpy is a collaboration-driven Python package providing tools for studying data from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

GWpy provides a user-friendly, intuitive interface to the common time-domain and frequency-domain data produced by the LIGO and Virgo instruments and their analysis, with easy-to-follow tutorials at each step.
