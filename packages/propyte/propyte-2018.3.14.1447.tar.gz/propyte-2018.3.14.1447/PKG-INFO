        setup LXPLUS with Pushbullet messaging
        ======================================
        
        Set up a Pushbullet account, create an access token and store a
        Pushbullet token in the file ``~/.pushbullet``. Install Pushbullet on a
        mobile device.
        
        -  `Pushbullet
           settings <https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings/account>`__
        -  `Pushbullet
           Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pushbullet.android>`__
        
        Miniconda2 is used as an environment. By default, Miniconda is installed
        at ``~/miniconda2`` and the Miniconda2 install path is prepended to PATH
        in ``~/.bashrc``.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
            chmod 755 Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
            ./Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
        
            export PATH=""${HOME}"/miniconda2/bin:$PATH"
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install propyte
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            propyte_alert.py --text="hello world"
        
        ``propyte_loop_alert_on_new_users.py``
        ======================================
        
        This script loop monitors for new user connections (using
        ``psutil.users()``) and sends an alert (using Pushbullet) is any are
        detected.
        
        smuggle
        =======
        
        Web modules can be imported using the function ``smuggle``. Use this
        functionality with due regard to security.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            shijian_test = propyte.smuggle(
                URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdbm/shijian/master/shijian.py"
            )
            sys_test = propyte.smuggle(
                module_name = "sys"
            )
        
        import\_ganzfeld, silence
        =========================
        
        The context manager function ``import_ganzfeld`` can be used to import a
        module such that the module is isolated from command line options and
        arguments. This can be useful for ROOT.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with propyte.import_ganzfeld():
                from ROOT import *
        
        The context manager function ``silence`` can be used to silence some
        code.
        
        user interactions
        =================
        
        There are various functions useful for user interactions:
        ``get_keystroke``, ``get_y_or_n``, ``get_input``,
        ``get_input_time_limited``, ``pause`` and ``interrogate``.
        
        commands
        ========
        
        The function ``engage_command`` is available for running Bash commands
        in the foreground or in the background using subprocess.
        
        speech
        ======
        
        The function ``say`` is available for generating speech using a number
        of different speech programs, including Festival, eSpeak, Pico TTS and
        deep\_throat.
        
        notifications
        =============
        
        Telegram
        ========
        
        This module provides Telegram messaging capabilities. It can send and
        receive Telegram messages. It does this using Telegram, Telegram CLI and
        pytg.
        
        In order to use Telegram functionality, ensure that both Telegram and
        Telegram CLI are running. The function ``start_messaging_Telegram``
        attempts to launch Telegram CLI if it does not detect it running.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            /usr/share/tg/bin/telegram-cli     \
                -R                             \
                -W                             \
                -P 4458                        \
                -k /usr/share/tg/tg-server.pub \
                --json                         \
                --permanent-peer-ids           \
                --permanent-peer-ids           \
                --disable-output               \
                --daemonize
        
        Messages can be sent in a way like the following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import propyte
            propyte.start_messaging_Telegram()
        
            propyte.send_message_Telegram(recipient = "@wbreadenmadden", text = "hi")
        
        Messages receiving can be engaged in the following way:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            import propyte
            propyte.start_messaging_Telegram()
            propyte.start_receiving_messages_Telegram()
        
        Messages received can be accessed in a number of ways using various
        function arguments.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            propyte.get_messages_received_Telegram()
        
        .. code:: python
        
            propyte.get_last_message_received_Telegram()
        
        .. code:: python
        
            propyte.get_text_last_message_received_Telegram()
        
        Pushbullet
        ==========
        
        Messages can be sent in ways like the following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import propyte
            propyte.start_messaging_Pushbullet()
        
            propyte.send_message_Pushbullet(
                recipient = "alice@neutronmail.ch",
                title     = "alert",
                text      = "This is an alert."
            )
        
            propyte.send_message_Pushbullet(
                recipients = ["alice@neutronmail.ch"],
                title      = "alert",
                text       = "This is an alert."
            )
        
            propyte.send_message_Pushbullet(
                recipient = "alice@neutronmail.ch",
                title     = "price alert",
                filepath  = "prices.png"
            )
        
        propyte\_loop\_alert\_on\_new\_users.py
        ---------------------------------------
        
        This script sends Pushbullet alerts on detection of new users or users
        changes.
        
        UML
        ===
        
        UML diagrams of a Python project can be generated using Pylint and
        Graphviz. This can be done by executing the Bash script ``UML.sh`` in
        the working directory of the project. This executes the following
        commands:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            project_name="${PWD##*/}"
            pyreverse -my -A -o png -p ${project_name} **.py
        
        This should generate two images, ``classes_propyte.png`` and
        ``packages_propyte.png``. The classes image is a representation of the
        classes of the project, their respective data attributes (with types),
        their respective methods and their inheritances. The packages image is a
        representation of the module dependencies of the project.
