        and stop the Webpack dev server.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install robotframework-webpack with pip::

        Usage
        -----
        
        In order to write your first robot test, make sure that you include Selenium2Library and WebpackLibrary. Create a test.robot file with the following content::
        
          *** Variables ***
          ${HOST}                 127.0.0.1
          ${PORT}                 8080
          ${BROWSER}              chrome
          ${SERVER}               http://${HOST}:${PORT}
        
        
          *** Settings ***

          *** Test Cases ***
        
          Scenario: Webpack Dev Server
            Go To  ${SERVER}
            # Amend this line to check for the real content of your app. Otherwise this test will fail.
            Wait until page contains  Hello World
            Page Should Contain  Hello World
        
        
          *** Keywords ***
        
          Start Webpack and Open Browser
            Start Webpack  yarn start
            Open Browser  ${SERVER}  ${BROWSER}
            Set Window Size  1280  1024
        
          Stop Webpack and Close Browser
            Stop Webpack
            Close Browser
        
        
        Keywords
        --------
        
        Start Webpack: Starts the webpack process. The keyword take the command line command to start Webpack (e.g. 'yarn start').
        
          Start Webpack  yarn start
        
        Optional parameters are:
        
          - path: relative or absolute path to the path where the command should be executed.
          - check: string that the keyword looks for in the Webpack output to know that Webpack has been fully started (default is 'Compiled successfully').
          - debug: returns debug information
        
        Example with all parameters set::
        
          Start Webpack  yarn start
          ..  path=tests/test-create-react-app
          ..  check=Compiled successfully
          ..  debug=True
        
        Stop Webpack: Stopps the webpack process that has been started with 'Start Webpack'.
        The keyword has no parameters.
        
        Rationale
        ---------
        
        You can start a Webpack process with standard Robot Framework keywords::
        
          Run process  yarn run build  shell=True  cwd=${CURDIR}
          Run process  yarn global add serve  shell=True  cwd=${CURDIR}
          Start process  serve -s build  shell=True  cwd=${CURDIR}
        
        You can even kill the process at the end of the test (suite)::
        
          Terminate All Processes  kill=True
        
        Though. You will need to set a sleep statement to wait until the Webpack
        process is fully up and running. Since this can take a considerable amount
        of time it will make your test suite inefficient and hard to scale.
        
        Robot Framework Webpack checks the output of the Webpack process until it
        is fully up and running. As soon as Webpack is ready, the test can continue.
        
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Project Setup::
        
          $ virtualenv-2.7 .py27
          $ source .py27/bin/activate
          $ pip install -r requirements.txt
          $ python setup.py develop
        
        Run Tests::
        
          $ .py27/bin/pybot tests

        - Remove br in README which breaks the pypi page.

        ------------------
        
        Breaking Changes:
        
        - Refactor 'Start Webpack' keyword.
          Remove "host", "port", "content_base", "config", "webpack_bin_path", "debug" params.
          Keep "path" param. Add required "command" param and an optional "check" param.

        Bugfixes:
        
        - Use a process group to start Webpack to being able to stop all child processes.
          This fixes issues with leftover child processes with create-react-app.
