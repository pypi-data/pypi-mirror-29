    Parameters
    ----------
    game : RsGame
        The game to find equilibria in. This function is most useful when game
        is a SchedulerGame, but any complete RsGame will work.
    initial_restriction : [[bool]], optional
        Initial restrictions to start inner loop from. If unspecified, every
        pure restriction is used.
    regret_thresh : float, optional
        The maximum regret to consider an equilibrium an equilibrium.
    dist_thresh : float, optional
        The minimum norm between two mixed profiles for them to be considered
        distinct.
    restricted_game_size : int > 0, optional
        The maximum restricted game support size with which beneficial
        deviations must be explored. Restricted games with support larger than
        this are queued and only explored in the event that no equilibrium can
        be found in beneficial deviations smaller than this.
    num_equilibria : int > 0, optional
        The number of equilibria to attempt to find. Only one is guaranteed,
        but this might be beneifical if the game has a known degenerate
        equilibria, but one which is still helpful as a deviating strategy.
    num_backups : int > 0, optional
        In the event that no equilibrium can be found in beneficial deviations
        to small restricted games, other restrictions will be explored. This
        parameter indicates how many restricted games for each role should be
        explored.
    devs_by_role : boolean, optional
        If specified, deviations will only be explored for each role in order,
        proceeding to the next role only when no beneficial deviations are
        found. This can reduce the number of profiles sampled, but may also
        fail to find certain equilibria due to the different path through
        restricted games.
    at_least_one : boolean, optional
        If specified, at least one equilibria will be found in each restricted
        game.  This has the potential to run for a very long time as it may
        take exponential time. If your regret threshold is not set too log for
        your game, this is relatively reasonable though.
