    Parameters
    ----------
    game : RsGame
        A gameanalysis game that indicates how array profiles should be turned
        into json profiles.
    config : {key: value}
        A dictionary mapping string keys to values that will be passed to the
        simulator in the standard simulation spec format.
    command : [str]
        A list of strings that represents a command line program to run. This
        program must accept simulation spec files as flushed lines of input to
        standard in, and write the resulting output as an observation to
        standard out. After all input lines have been read, this must flush the
        output otherwise this could hang waiting for results that are trapped
        in a buffer.
    sleep : int, optional
        Time in seconds to wait before checking programs stdout for results.
        Too low and a lot of cycles will be wasted querying an empty buffer,
        too fast and programs may be waiting for results while this is
        sleeping.
