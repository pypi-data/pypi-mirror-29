        Description
        ===========
        
        FilterZippedDBF allows values in unwanted fields in zipped DBF files to be removed.
        
        The zip archive is extracted into memory, so a permanent copy containing the values in unwanted fields is not made.  In particular when the zip archive is
        downloaded.
        
        A list of files in a zip archive is displayed.
        
        A list of fields in each DBF file is displayed.
        
        Select the fields whose values are to be removed.
        
        Save the files individually or write a new zip archive, with the values in the selected fields removed.
