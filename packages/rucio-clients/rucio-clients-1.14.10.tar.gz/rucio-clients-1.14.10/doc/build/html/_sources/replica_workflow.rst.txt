Typical replica workflow
========================

This section gives an overview of what happens within Rucio, for a typical replica workflow. Two workflows are described:
When a replica is uploaded to Rucio via a client and when a replica is created by a
site to site transfer due to the creation of a `replication rule`_.

Replica is uploaded with the command line client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a typical workflow when a user uploads mmultiple files, which are part of a dataset, via the command line client.

1. The dataset is being registered at the server.
   All files, or datasets are being put in a `scope`_, if not specifically mentioned the client will assume the default scope of the user,
   such as ``user.jdoe``


Replica is created by a replication rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
