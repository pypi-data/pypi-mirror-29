pydicom
=======

pydicom is a pure python package for parsing DICOM files. DICOM is a standard
(http://medical.nema.org) for communicating medical images and related
information such as reports and radiotherapy objects.

pydicom makes it easy to read these complex files into natural pythonic
structures for easy manipulation.  Modified datasets can be written again to
DICOM format files. See the `Getting Started
<https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/getting_started.html>`_ page for
installation and basic information, and the `Pydicom User Guide
<https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/getting_started.html>`_ page for
an overview of how to use the pydicom library.
