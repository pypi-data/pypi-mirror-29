        ## About
        Is an open-source graph package that contains algorithms for undirected/directed graphs and its written in **Python3.6** .
        
        ### Code Example
        ```python
        from XGraph import *
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
        
        	names = ['a','b','c','d'] # node-name list
        	g = Graph() # Create the Graph instance
        
        	createNodes(g,names) # Create the nodes based on the names list
        
          # Create the Weighted Edges
        	g.addEdge('a','b',1) 
        	g.addEdge('b','c',2)
        	g.addEdge('c','a',3)
        	g.addEdge('c','d',6)
          
          # Print the graph
        	printGraph(g)
          ```
