Description: # quad_form_ratio
        
        This package provides tools related to the distribution of ratios of quadratic forms in (zero mean) normal random variables. These are defined by
        
        $$
        R = \frac{\epsilon'A\epsilon}{\epsilon'B\epsilon}, \quad \text{for} \quad \epsilon \stackrel{D}{=} N(0,I)
        $$
        
        Included are functions for simulation, evaluation of the support, and saddlepoint approximations to the cdf $p = F(q) = P(R \leq q)$ and inverse cdf $q = F^{-1}(p)$.
