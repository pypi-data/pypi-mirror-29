Markdown-Include
================

This is an extension to
`Python-Markdown <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/>`__
which provides a selection of different extensions, in particular allowing
arbitary Python code to be run while Markdown is parsed.

It is originally based on `<https://github.com/cmacmackin/markdown-include>`__
