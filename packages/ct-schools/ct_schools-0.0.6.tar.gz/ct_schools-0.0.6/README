CT_SCHOOLS

    A python library for getting profile data on ct schools from fuzzy
    school names

    Data comes from here:
    https://data.ct.gov/Education/CT-Public-Schools/3z9z-e275

    And removes separates out the lat/lng from the school address field.

    Fuzziness comes from fuzzywuzzy: https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy

WHY?

    I have a lot of spreadsheets with school names spelled almost the same
    way. This helps a lot.
