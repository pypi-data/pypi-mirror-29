        About this project
        ------------------
        
        This project provides a Nova virtualization driver for the PR/SM hypervisor of
        IBM z Systems and IBM LinuxOne machines that are in the DPM (Dynamic Partition
        Manager) administrative mode.
        
        The DPM mode enables dynamic capabilities of the firmware-based PR/SM
        hypervisor that are usually known from software-based hypervisors, such as
        creation, deletion and modification of partitions (i.e. virtual machines) and
        virtual devices within these partitions, and dynamic assignment of these
        virtual devices to physical I/O adapters.
        
        The z/VM and KVM hypervisors on z Systems and LinuxONE machines are supported
        by separate Nova virtualization drivers:
        
        * KVM is supported by the standard libvirt/KVM driver in the
          `openstack/nova <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova>`_
          project.
        
        * z/VM is supported by the z/VM driver in the
          `openstack/nova-zvm-virt-driver <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova-zvm-virt-driver>`_
          project.
