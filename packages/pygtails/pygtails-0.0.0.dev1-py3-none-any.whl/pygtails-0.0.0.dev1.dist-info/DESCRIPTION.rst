Pygtails
========

A simple wrapper around the `pygame library <https://www.pygame.org>`_.

`Read the docs <http://pygtails.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?>`_

python 3.x

Installation
------------

As of right now I don't support pip, but I plan on getting that working in the very nearby future. For now you can just copy the pygtails.py file from the source folder into whatever directory you'll be using it.
