Description
===========

Mount WebHDFS on your local Linux or Mac file system

After this, you can access the WebHDFS file system as if was a local
directory - with regular Unix file operations.

Installation
============

First dependency is fuse, you can install it on Ubuntu with:

::

    sudo apt-get install fuse

or on RedHat with:

::

    sudo yum install fuse

after that, you can simply run:

::

    pip3 install fuse_webhdfs

and this should pull in all dependencies

Preparing IBM internal certificates
-----------------------------------

If you’re running on IBM network, you’ll need IBM internal certificate
chain. You can run the following commands to prepare this chain:

::

    curl -L https://daymvs1.pok.ibm.com/ibmca/downloadCarootCert.do\?file\=carootcert.der | openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM > ibm-chain.crt
    curl -L https://daymvs1.pok.ibm.com/ibmca/downloadCarootCert.do\?file\=caintermediatecert.der | openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM >> ibm-chain.crt

And in the following configuration step please provide ‘ibm-chain.crt’
as the HDFS web server certificate path.

Usage
=====

In one terminal type:

::

    mkdir -p ~/fuse-webhdfs
    python3 mount-webhdfs.py ~/fuse-webhdfs

You now have to type in your HDFS endpoint parameters and HDFS (Knox)
username and password. For IBM internal use, please provide your w3id
username and password.

These parameters will be saved in plain text in
``$HOME/.config/webhdfs.ini``. If you have a problem with that, please
create a pull request and I will be happy to consider merging it.

After mounting, in other terminal(s) you will be able to list files,
read them, etc. For example:

::

    ls -l ~/fuse-webhdfs/tmp
    echo "this is a test" > ~/fuse-webhdfs/tmp/test
    cat ~/fuse-webhdfs/tmp/test
