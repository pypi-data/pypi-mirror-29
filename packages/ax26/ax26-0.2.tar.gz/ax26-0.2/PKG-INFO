Description: # AX26
        
        This is meant to be a successor to the AX25 protocol. It has many advantages:
        
        * Unlimited data sizes (Broken up into smaller packets seamlessly)
        
        * Configurable packet sizes
        
        * Built in compression (Level 9 gzip)
        
        * IDs that are basically limitless (Up to the size of the packet)
        
        * Error correction (MD5)
        
        The library is very WIP and should not be used in production. Classes and functions are subject to change.
        
        
        There is a client and a server class. The client is made to connect to the server, and the server will accept connections from as many clients as you want, spawning a new thread for each.
        Please look at the example code for more information.
