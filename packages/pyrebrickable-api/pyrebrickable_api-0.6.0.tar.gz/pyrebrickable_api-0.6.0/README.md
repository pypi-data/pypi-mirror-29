# pyrebrickable

This is pyrebrickable, containing two packages:

## rebrickable_api

The rebrickable_api Python package is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.

## rebrickable_cli

This Python package provides a CLI wrapper around the Rebrickable API<br> <br> It supports the v3 API through it's openAPI specification.<br> https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/swagger/?format=openapi<br> Models for Part, Set, etc. have been manually added to provide meaningful results from HTTP responses<br> <br> Some endpoints might not work, don't hesitate to file an issue<br>

Once the pyrebrickable package is installed through `pip install pyrebrickable` you should have access to a `rebrickable` command.

Combined documentation can be found in a Github Pages repo [here](https://rienafairefr.github.io/pyrebrickable)

## Requirements.
