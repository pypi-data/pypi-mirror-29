A Python implementation of the Statistical Coupling Analysis method. 
The current project uses the clustering method to identify sectors of 
functionally related residues. Results of the analysis are presented through 
intuitive and interactive visualizations, including heatmaps, 3d scatter 
plots, and structural mapping.
