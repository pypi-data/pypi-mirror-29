        The pylibcklb library an package of different functions and classes for programming in python.
        
        ## Requirements

        ## Usage

        ```python
        # Import of the package functions
        from pylibcklb.FunctionLibrary import HelloWorld
        
        # Main fucntion to call with python interpreter
        def main():
        
            # Simple function call
            HelloWorld()
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```
        
        Call the main.py with python from command line:
        ```batch
        python.exe main.py
        ```
        Output of the command line:
