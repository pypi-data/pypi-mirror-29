        want to semi-supervise your machine learning?
        
        This package is designed to provide a `ipywidget`-based interactive labelling tool for your data.
        
        It's very much in early early alpha, so don't expect it to work! But if you want to have a go, here's how you would do it:
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```
        pip install superintendent
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```python
        from superintendent import SemiSupervisor
        
        example_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janfreyberg/superintendent/master/example_test.csv')
        
        print(example_df)
        ```
        
        ```
                       sentence  sentiment
        0     This is terrible.         -1
        1        This is great.          1
        2           Outrageous!         -1
        3  I don't believe you.          1
        4               Get out          1
        5     I love the anger.         -1
        ```
        
        This is a small & silly example dataframe, but as you can see, the labels
        aren't right (e.g. `Get out.` is labelled positive). So let's create some new
        labels.
        
        ```python
        widget = SemiSupervisor(example_df[['sentence']], example_df[['sentiment']])
        
        widget.annotate()
        ```
        
        ![](screenshot.png)
        
        Once you've clicked through and done all your labelling, you can get your new
        labels from the widget:
        
        ```python
        print(widget.new_labels)
        ```
        
        ```
          sentiment
        0        -1
        1         1
        2        -1
        3        -1
        4        -1
        5         1
        ```
