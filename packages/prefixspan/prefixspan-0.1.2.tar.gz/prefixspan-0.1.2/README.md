[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/prefixspan.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/prefixspan)

The shortest yet efficient implementation of [PrefixSpan](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jpei/publications/span.pdf) in Python 3, in less than 15 lines in core part. You can find the Scala version [here](https://github.com/chuanconggao/PrefixSpan-scala).

It is very simple to use this package under Python 2. You only need to tweak 2-3 lines.

# Installation

This package is available on PyPi. Just use `pip3 install -U prefixspan` to install it.

# CLI Usage
You can simply use the algorithm on terminal.
```
prefixspan-cli (frequent | top-k) <threshold> [--minlen=1] [--maxlen=maxint] [<file>]
```

  * Sequences are read from standard input. Each sequence is integers separated by space, like this example:
```
0 1 2 3 4
1 1 1 3 4
2 1 2 2 0
1 1 1 2 2
```

  * The patterns and their respective frequencies are printed to standard output.

# API Usage
Alternatively, you can use the algorithm via API.
``` python
from prefixspan.api import PrefixSpan

db = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    [1, 1, 1, 3, 4],
    [2, 1, 2, 2, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 2, 2],
]

ps = PrefixSpan(db)

print(ps.frequent(2))
print(ps.topk(10))
```

# Features
Outputs traditional single-item sequential patterns, where gaps are allowed between items.

  * Mining top-k patterns is also supported, with respective optimizations.
  * You can also limit the length of mined patterns. Note that setting maximum pattern length properly can significantly speedup the algorithm.

# Tip
I strongly encourage using PyPy instead of CPython to run the script for best performance. In my own experience, it is nearly 10 times faster in average.
