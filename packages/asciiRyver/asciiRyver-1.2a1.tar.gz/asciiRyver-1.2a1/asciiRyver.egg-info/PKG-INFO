        ==========
        
        asciiRyver is a `Ryver`_ chat client designed to be able to run in the terminal. This was built on the `Asciimatics`_ framework. This is not designed to be professional software, and it is still in the early phases of development. At present, there may be lots of bugs encountered, but the basic chat functionality is working, including: forums, workgroups, direct messaging, topics, and topic creation.

        If someone sends an image or gif via chat, it may append two lines to the chat you are in.
        
        If you create a new topic, you may not see responses in that topic until you refresh and rejoin the topic.
