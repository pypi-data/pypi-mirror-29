Tag Based Element Filtering
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For removing individual elements from notebooks, we need a way to signal to
nbconvert that the elements should be removed. With this release, we introduce
the use of tags for that purpose.

Tags are user-defined strings attached to cells or outputs. They are stored in
cell or output metadata. For more on tags see the `nbformat docs on cell
metadata <http://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#cell-metadata>`__.

**Usage**: 

1. Apply tags to the elements that you want to remove. 
   
For removing an entire cell, the cell input, or all cell outputs apply the tag
to the cell. 

For removing individual outputs, put the tag in the output metadata
using a call like ``display(your_output_element, metadata={tags=[<your_tags_here>]})``. 

*NB*: Use different tags depending on whether you want to remove the entire cell, the input, all outputs, or individual outputs.

2. Add the tags for removing the different kinds of elements to the following
   traitlets. Which kind of element you want to remove determines which
   traitlet you add the tags to.

The following traitlets remove elements of different kinds: 

- ``remove_cell_tags``: removes cells 
- ``remove_input_tags``: removes inputs
- ``remove_all_outputs_tag``: removes all outputs  
- ``remove_single_output_tag``: removes individual outputs

5.2.1
-----

`5.2 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/milestones/5.2>`__

Major features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this release (along with the usual bugfixes and documentation improvements,
which are legion) we have a few new major features that have been requested for
a long time:

Global Content Filtering
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You now have the ability to remove input or output from code cells, markdown
cells and the input and output prompts. The easiest way to access all of these
is by using traitlets like TemplateExporter.exclude_input = True (or, for
example HTMLExporter.exclude_markdown = True if you wanted to make it specific
to HTML output). On the command line if you just want to not have input or
output prompts just use --no-prompt.

Execute notebooks from a function
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can now use the executenb function to execute notebooks as though you ran
the execute preprocessor on the notebooks. It returns the standard notebook and
resources options.

Remove cells based on regex pattern
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This removes cells based on their matching a regex pattern (by default, empty
cells). This is the RegexRemovePreprocessor.

Script exporter entrypoints for nonpython scripts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now there is an entrypoint for having an exporter specific to the type of script
that is being exported. While designed for use with the IRkernel in particular
(with a script exporter focused on exporting R scripts) other non-python kernels
that wish to have a language specific exporter can now surface that directly.
