Description: py-jsonapi (DEPRECATED)
        =======================
        
        **>> This library is no longer maintained.<<**
        Traffic indicates not a large user base and I don't use this library myself
        anymore. If you want to use it in the future, then you should maintain your
        own fork. I will remove *py-jsonapi* from PyPi and GitHub at 1.1.2019.
        
        This library is a toolkit for building a http://jsonapi.org/ compliant API. It
        has built in support for many web frameworks and database drivers:
        
        *   flask
        *   tornado
        *   sqlalchemy
        *   mongoengine
        *   motorengine
        
        Furthermore, it can be extended to work with **all web frameworks and database
        engines**.
        
        But that's not all: We support **blocking and asynchronous** code.
