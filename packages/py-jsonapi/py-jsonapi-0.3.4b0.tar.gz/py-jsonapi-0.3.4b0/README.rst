py-jsonapi (DEPRECATED)
=======================

**>> This library is no longer maintained.<<**
Traffic indicates not a large user base and I don't use this library myself
anymore. If you want to use it in the future, then you should maintain your
own fork. I will remove *py-jsonapi* from PyPi and GitHub at 1.1.2019.

This library is a toolkit for building a http://jsonapi.org/ compliant API. It
has built in support for many web frameworks and database drivers:

*   flask
*   tornado
*   sqlalchemy
*   mongoengine
*   motorengine

Furthermore, it can be extended to work with **all web frameworks and database
engines**.

But that's not all: We support **blocking and asynchronous** code.
