att-bill-splitter
=================

Are you an AT&T account holder for multiple wireless lines and tired of manually splitting the bill, typing into spreadsheet and sending each of your user text message every month? Now you can automate all of that with this application.

Overview
--------

This package is written in Python (works with both Python 2 and 3) and uses requests and beautifulsoup4 to login your AT&T account and parse the bills. peewee is used as the ORM and data are stored in a Sqlite database. Command line interface is built with click. It also has twilio integration to send auto-generated monthly billing details to each user.

Installation
------------

via pip
~~~~~~~
::

    [~] pip install att-bill-splitter


via source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    [~] git clone https://github.com/brianzq/att-bill-splitter.git
    [~] cd att-bill-splitter
    [att-bill-splitter] pip install .

*I recommend using a virtualenv to isolate all the dependencies of this application from your local packages.*

Quick Start
-----------

Parse And Split Bills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the first thing you run. You will be prompted to input your AT&T username and password (within terminal). Once logged in, it will start parsing your previous bills, splitting them and storing data to database.
::

    [att-bill-splitter] att-split-bill

For example
::

    [att-bill-splitter] att-split-bill
    👤  AT&T Username: your_att_username
    🗝  AT&T Password:
    ▶  Login started...
    ✅  Login succeeded.
    🏃  Start splitting bill Sep 15 - Oct 14, 2016...
    🏁  Finished splitting bill Sep 15 - Oct 14, 2016.
    🏃  Start splitting bill Aug 15 - Sep 14, 2016...
    🏁  Finished splitting bill Aug 15 - Sep 14, 2016.
    🏃  Start splitting bill Jul 15 - Aug 14, 2016...
    🏁  Finished splitting bill Jul 15 - Aug 14, 2016.
    🏃  Start splitting bill Jun 15 - Jul 14, 2016...
    🏁  Finished splitting bill Jun 15 - Jul 14, 2016.
    🏃  Start splitting bill May 15 - Jun 14, 2016...
    🏁  Finished splitting bill May 15 - Jun 14, 2016.
    🏃  Start splitting bill Apr 15 - May 14, 2016...
    🏁  Finished splitting bill Apr 15 - May 14, 2016.

By default it parses all your previous bills. If you want to select a few bills to parse, you can use ``-l`` option. The value of the option is the lag of the bill compared to the most recent one. So ``0`` refers to the most recent bill, ``1`` is one month before that and so on. For example,
::

    [att-bill-splitter] att-split-bill -l 0
    👤  AT&T Username: your_att_username
    🗝  AT&T Password:
    ▶  Login started...
    ✅  Login succeeded.
    🏃  Start splitting bill Sep 15 - Oct 14, 2016...
    🏁  Finished splitting bill Sep 15 - Oct 14, 2016.

You can supply multiple ``-l`` options at once.

**NOTE**: If your users overused your plan's data, you will probably get charged $15 for each additional Gigabyte like I do. When that happens, the charges for the additional data usage are split among user who used more than their monthly share (monthly_total_allowance / number_of_user), proportionally to the extra amount used. The details will be printed when you run above command, like this:

::

    [att-bill-splitter] att-split-bill -l 0
    👤  AT&T Username: your_att_username
    🗝  AT&T Password:
    ▶  Login started...
    ✅  Login succeeded.
    🏃  Start splitting bill Sep 15 - Oct 14, 2016...
    User USER_NAME_1 over used 0.1 GB data, will be charged extra $0.68
    User USER_NAME_3 over used 0.69 GB data, will be charged extra $4.70
    User USER_NAME_4 over used 0.3 GB data, will be charged extra $2.06
    User USER_NAME_7 over used 3.31 GB data, will be charged extra $22.57
    🏁  Finished splitting bill Sep 15 - Oct 14, 2016.

View Monthly Charges Summary for Users

After you parsed the bills, you can view them in your terminal. The command below will print the monthly summary for each user.
