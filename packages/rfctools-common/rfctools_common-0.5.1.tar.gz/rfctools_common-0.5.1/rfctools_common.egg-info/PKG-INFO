Description: RFC Editor Tools Utility Code
        =============================
        
        This module contains a set of utility functions used by some of the RFC Editor tools.
        Long term, the goal is to incorperate these functions back into xml2rfc but having it
        separate allows for an easier modification of the functions as needed.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 0.5.1 (Sun XX MAR)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Setup to publish to PyPI
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.5.0 (Sun 25 Feb)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Setup log routines so that UTF-8 strings can be written on
        	  all consoles.  This is a problem as Python v2 thinks consoles
        	  are written assumed to be ASCII and for Windows it is the code
        	  page of the console.  Pipes have a third method of making this decision
        	* Swap the order of two attributes to match the order in the
        	  xmlrfc v2 to v3 upgrade program.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.0.3 (Sun 11 Feb)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* For python 3.x read file as binary not text, deals with UTF-8 problems
        	* Include RFC2629 DTD for the XMLDIFF so that we can load old xml files
