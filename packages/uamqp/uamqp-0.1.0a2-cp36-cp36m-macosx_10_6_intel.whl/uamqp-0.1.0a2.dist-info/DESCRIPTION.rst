uAMQP for Python
================

An AMQP 1.0 client library for Python.


Installation
============

Wheels are provided for all major operating systems, so you can install directly with pip:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install uamqp


If you are running a Linux distro that does not support `ManyLinux1 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513>`__, you can install from source:

.. code:: shell

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev python3-dev uuid-dev cmake python3-pip
    $ pip3 install uamqp --no-binary


Python 2.7 support
++++++++++++++++++
Coming soon...


Developer Setup
===============
In order to run the code directly, the Cython extension will need to be build first.

Pre-requisites
++++++++++++++

- Windows: None
- Linux: Install dependencies as descriped above in the installation instructions.
- MacOS: Install OpenSSL and UUID using Homebrew:

.. code:: shell

    $ brew install openssl@1.1
    $ brew install ossp-uuid

Building the extension
++++++++++++++++++++++

This project has two C library dependencies:

- `Azure uAMQP for C <https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-c>`__
- `Azure Shared Utility <https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility>`__

They are vendored in this repository in these versions:
- Azure uAMQP @1.2.0
- Azure C Shared Utility @2018-03-07-temp-pod

To build, start by creating a virtual environment and installing the required Python packages:

.. code:: shell

    $ python -m venv env
    $ env/Scripts/activate
    (env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Next, run the build command:

.. code:: shell

    $ python setup.py built_ext --inplace

Tests
+++++

The tests can be run from within the virtual environment. The extension must be built first using the instructions above.

.. code:: shell

    (env)$ pytest
