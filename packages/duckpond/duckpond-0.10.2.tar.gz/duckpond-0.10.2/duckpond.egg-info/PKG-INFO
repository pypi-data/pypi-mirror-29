Description: 
        A [semantic data lake](http://cacm.acm.org/news/200095-the-data-lake-concept-is-maturing/fulltext) can
        be thought of a set of resources annotated with semantics (i.e., triples or quads).  In the context of big data,
        a "data lake" is a massive repository of data, structured or unstructured, of which we gain knowledge of
        its contents by examining the semantic graphs derived from their contents.
        
        That's a big idea.  This project is about a *semantic data lake* at a much smaller
        scale: a pond. I also like ducks and so it is a *duck pond*.
        
        We can paddle around in our content, just like a duck, and harvest a bit knowledge
        to derive local value.  In this case, we use the semantic pond to understand the
        content, its inter-relations, ordering, and other such content relations.  From
        that, we can derive a useful presentation on the Web.
