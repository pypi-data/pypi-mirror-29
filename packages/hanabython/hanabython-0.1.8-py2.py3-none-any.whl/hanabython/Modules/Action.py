    """
    An action performed by a player (Throw, Play a card, Clue or Forfeit).

    In the end-user interfaces (including methods ``colored``), "throw" should
    be called "discard" and "play a card" can be called "play" (to be consistent
    with the official rules). In the code however, we prefer to use "throw"
    (to distinguish from other forms of discards, for example after a misfire)
    and "play a card" (to distinguish from simply playing in general).

    :param category: can be :attr:`Action.THROW`, :attr:`Action.PLAY_CARD`,
        :attr:`Action.CLUE` or :attr:`Action.FORFEIT`.

    Generally, only subclasses are instantiated. Cf. :class:`ActionThrow`,
    :class:`ActionPlayCard`, :class:`ActionClue` and :class:`ActionForfeit`.
