Description: It's All Ghosts
        ===============
        
        What this is
        ------------
        
        It's All Ghosts is a universal "editor extension" for the GhostText_ browser
        add-on.
        
        While `It's All Text`_ was able to spawn almost any editor, GhostText focuses
        on such editors that are able to run plugin code on their own. This leaves
        users of most simple editors, like joe_, jupp_, nano_, gedit_ or kwrite_ behind.
        
        Compared to fully supported editors, there is a small trade-off: GhostText
        can update the text live between the input field and the editor.  This is
        not possible with It's All Ghosts.  Instead, It's All Ghosts simply spawns
        the editor on connect and passes the file contents back on exit.  It does,
        however, update the temporary file upon a change notification from the
        browser and some editors track file modifications - don't use that, however,
        because it will almost certainly destroy your contents somewhere.
        
        But apart from that, you can now again use your favourite editor again!
        
        How to install
        --------------
        
        You need to install/run with python3_.
        
        The easiest way to install It's All Ghosts is to use pip_.
        If you've got Python 3.4+ or 2.7.9+, pip will be installed by default on
        Windows, otherwise pip-install_ will help you install pip.  If you use
        pip to install, by-default it will install the latest version of ItsAllGhosts
        posted to https://pypi.python.org, along with all dependencies when you
        install like this (on Windows)::
        
            c:\>c:\Python36\scripts\pip.exe install ItsAllGhosts
        
        Be sure to run the pip.exe that is located in your Python 3.x installation
        directory, as in the above example.
        
        For Unix environments you also need to ensure that you use the Python3
        version of pip, so your installation will look like this::
        
            ~$ sudo pip3 install ItsAllGhosts
        
        More advanced examples of installing with pip (e.g., if you would like to
        install a development version of It's All Ghosts not yet present at
        pypi.python.org) can be found at
        https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/.
        
        If you don't have pip or choose not to use it, you can still install by
        just changing into the extracted installation directory and running
        "setup.py install" with python3_, as in the examples below.
        
        Example in Unix environments::
        
            $ sudo python3 setup.py install
        
        Example in Windows environments::
        
            C:\Users\me\Downloads\itsallghosts>c:\Python36\python.exe setup.py install
        
        How to define your editor
        -------------------------
        
        It's All Ghosts defaults to running:
        
        - nano in an xterm for Unix environments
        - `notepad++`_ for Windows environments
        
        You can place your own script to execute as the editor into:
        
        - for Unix environments: ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/itsallghosts_cmd``
          (``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` defaults to ``~/.config/``)
        
        - for Windows environments: ``%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%\itsallghosts.cmd``
          (``%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%`` defaults to ``C:\Users\<username>\.config\``);
          note that the file extension MUST be ".cmd" to satisfy Windows cmd.exe
        
        - Unix example which runs jstar (from the joe_ suite) in KDE's Konsole
          instead of the default::
        
            exec konsole --separate -e jstar $*
        
        - Windows example which runs the xfte editor instead of the default::
        
            c:\tools\xfte.exe %*
        
        How to run
        ----------
        
        Just make sure that ``itsallghosts`` is running in your desktop session.
        
        Example for Unix::
        
            $ itsallghosts
        
        Example for Windows::
        
            c:\Python36>scripts\itsallghosts.exe
        
        Multi-user mode (Unix only)
        ---------------------------
        
        The architecture of the GhostText protocol does not allow running on a
        multi-user system, as it relies on port 4001 being available to exactly one
        user.
        
        It's All Ghosts can be run as a system service, handing off single sessions
        to the corresponding user. This is done by introspecting the HTTP connection
        and is a bit of black magic not guaranteed to work correctly.
        
        To run the system service, simply run ``itsallghosts`` as root (this is the
        only way of getting hold of socket owners).
        
        In each user session then run::
        
            itsallghosts --user
        
        Development and contributing
        ----------------------------
        
        It's All Ghosts is very basic and sure can use some improvements. You can
        report issues or contribute in the `EduGit repository` (also open to GitHub
        and other users).
