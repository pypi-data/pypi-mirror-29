        Learning from bidict
        --------------------
        
        One of the most rewarding things about working on bidict
        ‚Äì and also the most surprising,
        especially in light of the small codebase ‚Äì
        is how much fun, advanced Python
        has turned up in the process.
        
        Check out `learning-from-bidict` [#fn-learning]_
        if you're interested in learning more.
        (And if that piques your interest,
        perhaps you'd like to `become a reviewer <#reviewers-wanted>`_?)
        
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        Bidict is currently a one-person operation
        maintained on a voluntary basis
        with no other sponsorship.
        Your help would be most welcome!
        
        
        Reviewers Wanted!
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. `this issue <...>`__ avoids "Duplicate explicit target name" Sphinx warning
        .. caused by other `this issue <...>`_ link above. See:
        .. https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3921#issuecomment-315581557
        
        One of the most valuable ways to contribute is to become a reviewer.
        If you are interested in reviewing future changes,
        please +1 `this issue <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/63>`__.
        
        Doing a complete review of latest master would also be tremendously helpful.
        There are currently only about 650 lines of code,
        so a full review may not even take much time.
        
        If you see some code, tests, docs, or anything else that could use improvement,
        please open an issue or submit a pull request.
        (On the off chance you finish a review without spotting any issues,
        please let me know that too!)
        
        If you are interested in getting a guided tour of the codebase
        to help with your review,
        I would be happy to try to coordinate a screenshare.
        
        
        Becoming a Sponsor
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
