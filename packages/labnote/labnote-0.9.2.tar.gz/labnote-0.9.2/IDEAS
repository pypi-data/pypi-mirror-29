Some possible features to implement in the future:

1. Use xdg library to lookup XDG_CONFIG_HOME and check for labnote config there
   (Linux), or standard locations on Mac (e.g.
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3373948/equivalents-of-xdg-config-home-and-xdg-data-home-on-mac-os-x)
2. Add option to output Markdown (e.g. for hosting on  Github)
3. Add option to color entries based on activity (e.g. gradient from blue or
   grey -> orange)
