thermoplotting is my solution to the constant need for plotting thermodynamic
data in graduate school. It's meant primarily to interface with casm, but contains
a few modules that could be used with raw data, such as plotting ECI values or
energy-composition plots with convex hulls.

In addition to plotting data, new features are added as I need them, such as manipulating
basis functions, plotting primitive cells in reciprocal space, or integrating Monte Carlo
data to get Grand Canonical free energies.
