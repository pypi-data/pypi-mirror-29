AWS EC2 instance manager for Minecraft servers
==============================================

Requires a Python version of 3.6. Can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ pip install ec2mc

A Python console script for managing Minecraft servers hosted on AWS EC2 instances.
Currently the script can only start and check the status of instances, but I am attempting to make it modular, and include validation and documentation.

IAM user credentials must be set before the script can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ec2mc configure

Sample credentials (with minimal permissions) are the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	AWS access key ID: AKIAJSJIRSCFBLUWRG2Q
	AWS secret access key: N3zwOS1QanjGNgYO3uQ/ObN0Hjh0R3X27UW2abnq

"File path for Minecraft's servers.dat" can be left empty.
The previous IAM user credentials have been included to facilitate a basic understanding of what the script is doing.
The instance turns itself off after 10 minutes, so feel free to start it.

Full commands to be used are the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ec2mc check_server -r eu-central-1 -t Name chisels-and-bits-1
	$ ec2mc start_server -r eu-central-1 -t Name chisels-and-bits-1

To see how the script updates the Minecraft client's server list, install Minecraft and add the MC client's servers.dat path to the config with "ec2mc configure".
The script can't handle a non-existent/empty server list (yet?), so please add an entry to the Minecraft client's server list before using the script (gibberish is fine, as long as an entry exists).
