## Classes
* [`Junc`](#junc) - Handles the docopt args and connects to servers

### `Junc`
This class handles a dictionary generated by `docopt`. It takes no constructor arguments, other than an optional `testing` arg. Code for this class is in `junc/__init__.py`

It has 2 attributes, a `ServerList` called `junc.sl`, and a `Storage` handler called `junc.st`.

It contains a method `what_to_do_with`, which takes `docopt` args and performs the desired behavior.
```python
args = docopt(__doc__)
junc = Junc()
junc.what_to_do_with(args) # Where the magic happens
```
