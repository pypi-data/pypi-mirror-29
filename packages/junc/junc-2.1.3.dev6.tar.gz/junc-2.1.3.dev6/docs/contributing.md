This is a small project, I'm not picky. If you want to develop a new feature, go for it. Following the suggestions below will increase your chances of getting merged.

## Suggestions
1. New features should be reasonable
2. New features should be contained in a branch of the `dev` branch. Create a pull request when ready.
3. Features should be covered by unit tests. I'm using the standard `unittest` package for tests, but you can use whatever you want. Keep your tests contained in a file in the `junc/tests` directory.
4. You should write documentation for your feature. Add a section to the "Things You Can Do" part of `docs/index.md`, describing how your feature should be used, and any optional arguments.
