Tasks
=====

A (resolved) task unit looks like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   meta:
     env_name: the nameof the environment this task belongs to (autogenerated)
     env_id: the id of the environment this task belongs to (autogenerated)
     name: <name of the task>
     task-name: <internal ansible task or role name>
     task-type: <either 'role' or 'task'>
     task-roles: <list of all dependency ansible roles, either in string format or as dicts>
     role-name: <name of the generated role, only applicable for task-type 'task', different role-name indicates new role, empty either uses last role-name, or autogenerated one>
     with_items: <key under 'vars' to be used in the 'with_items' ansible task directive>
     split_key: similar to 'with_items', but splits up tasks earlier, and creates seperate tasks in the generated playbook/role
   vars:
     <the task/role vars>


Role_dicts:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: the url or local path to the role
   version: the version (if remote)
   name: the name of the role
