Introduction
==============

This is a solution for the self-tracking rowers.

Some of us use Concept2 rowing machines. Some of us are On-The-Water 
rowers. All of us will use smartphone apps, smart watches, fitness (GPS)
watches, etc. to track our activities.

Most of them will cross-train. Bike. Run. Skate.

That means, the Concept2 logbook is not a sufficient training logbook for us.

At the same time, the Concept2 logbook is used in rankings, for challenges,
and more. Many of us will want to log all our rowing on the Concept2 logbook.

So there are a couple of challenges here:

* How do I get my erg rows on Strava/SportTracks/Garmin Connect?

	* Use an ANT+ device, like explained here: https://dr3do.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/hurray/

	* Import from RowPro to SportTracks

	* There are many smartphone apps to capture data from the PM3/4/5 erg monitor. Not many of them export in a format that is suitable for upload to the above-mentioned sites.

* How do I get all my rows (including OTW) into the Concept2 logbook 

	* For On-Water and Erg: Add them manually

	* For erg: Upload from ErgData, RowPro, Concept2 utility 

This project aims at giving you ways to:

* Upload fitness data captured in TCX format to the Concept2 logbook (implemented)

	* This should cover all your On-Water activities, whether they are captured with a SpeedCoach, a GPS fitness watch, your phone, or any other device. As long as you are able to export a valid TCX file.

* Get erg data captured with apps that have no "upload to Concept2" functionality and upload them to the Concept2 logbook (implemented)

	* For example, painsled

* Get erg data captured with apps that have no TCX export functionality and convert hem to TCX (implemented)

	* ErgData - downloaded to CSV, converted to TCX

	* RowPro data - exported to CSV, converted to TCX. 

* Make the data accessible in python and create useful plots. Who wants to be limited to what the on-line logbooks plot. Get your data and create:

	* Color HR band charts or Pie Charts (implemented)

	* Plot drive length, drive time, and other erg related parameters as a function of time or distance (implemented)

	* Create histograms (Do-it-yourself). 

	* And much more (do-it-yourself). You've got the entire Python matplotlib at your disposal. Goodbye excel!

As soon as Crewnerd or Speedcoach can upload to C2 natively, or a web
synchronization can be set up between the C2 logbook and popular fitness 
tracking sites, my project will lose much of its significance. But that's OK. 

Well, at least the colorful plots remain.

Credits
===============

The project is based on python plotting code by 
Greg Smith (https://quantifiedrowing.wordpress.com/) 
and inspired by the RowPro Dan Burpee spreadsheet 
(http://www.sub7irc.com/RP_Split_Template.zip).

===============
To install 
===============

::

	$ easy_install rowingdata

Or ::

	$ pip install rowingdata


To upgrade: ::

$ pip install --upgrade rowingdata

or ::

$ easy_install --upgrade rowingdata

Numpy, SciPy and matplotlib are needed. On Linux systems, they should be installed automatically through the dependencies. 

On Windows, there may be installation issues. 

A workaround is to install Anaconda, as described here: https://www.scipy.org/install.html

Another option is to use official 32-bit installers:

* http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/

Or you can fetch the unofficial but recommended Windows releases from

* http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ (get the MKL builds for NumPy)	

======================
Command Line Tools
======================

Beta. Use with caution.

The easiest way to use rowingdata is from the command line. 

First, create a rower data file (if you don't have one yet). Just run the 
following command and answer a few questions about yourself. If you don't 
know what heart rate bands are, check here http://www.freespiritsrowing.com/content/utilities/hr-bands/ : ::

	$ roweredit yourfilename.txt

You can omit the file name. This will create a file defaultrower.txt. 
You can always run the same command to change parameters (for example 
if you lost or gained weight, change the user name or password, etc.

.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\editrower.JPG

Now you need the data files for your row. (The install comes with a few test 
files.) Get a TCX file (and a CSV summary file) from CrewNerd. TCX files from 
other tools should also work (not tested), as long as the TCX is valid.

Or get a CSV export from painsled. 


TCX files
-----------

Generic TCX
....................

If you have a generic TCX file (from a SpeedCoach, from a Garmin), the 
following will create plots and spit out some summary text ::

	$ tcxplot tcxfile.tcx yourrower.txt

.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\greghoc.png

If you prefer a time based plot: ::

	$ tcxplottime tcxfile.tcx yourrower.txt

Some TCX files do not have GPS position data. For example SpeedCoach with impeller. 
In that case: ::

	$ tcxplot_nogeo tcxfile.tcx yourrower.txt
	$ tcxplottime_nogeo tcxfile.tcx yourrower.txt

The following will upload your row to the Concept2 logbook, and create a 
file crewnerddata.tcx_o.csv that looks like a painsled csv, for future use ::

	$ tcxtoc2 tcxfile.tcx yourrower.txt

Again, yourrower.txt is optional.


.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\otwscreenshot.JPG

Here is the row on the Concept2 logbook:

.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\otwlogbook.JPG



CrewNerd with summary
.......................

Having a crewnerddata.csv (summary csv) and a crewnerddata.tcx, the following 
will create plots and spit out some summary text ::

	$ crewnerdplot crewnerddata yourrower.txt

The yourrower.txt argument is the file where you keep your rower data. 
This is optional. If you don't provide it, the tool will look for 
defaultrower.txt. If it doesn't find that, it will use some default values. 

The script will also spit out some statistics from the summary csv.

.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\woensdag.png


If you prefer a time based plot: ::

	$ crewnerdplottime crewnerddata yourrower.txt



Painsled
------------

Having painsled data in testdata.csv, the following will create plots and
spit out some summary text ::

	$ painsledplot testdata.csv yourrower.txt

or ::

	$ painsledplottime testdata.csv yourrower.txt

The yourrower.txt argument is the file where you keep your rower data. 
This is optional. If you don't provide it, the tool will look for 
defaultrower.txt. If it doesn't find that, it will use some default values. 

.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\2x20min.png



The following will upload your row to the Concept2 logbook: ::

	$ painsledtoc2 testdata.csv yourrower.txt

Again, yourrower.txt is optional.

.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\screenshot.JPG

Here is the row on the Concept2 logbook

.. image:: C:\python\rowingdata\screenshots\screenshotlogbook.JPG


SpeedCoach GPS
---------------------

Having SpeedCoach GPS data in testdata.csv, the following will create plots and
spit out some summary text ::

	$ speedcoachplot testdata.csv yourrower.txt

or ::

	$ speedcoachplottime testdata.csv yourrower.txt

The yourrower.txt argument is the file where you keep your rower data. 
This is optional. If you don't provide it, the tool will look for 
defaultrower.txt. If it doesn't find that, it will use some default values. 

The following will upload your row to the Concept2 logbook: ::

	$ speedcoachtoc2 testdata.csv yourrower.txt '2015-11-05T13:15:30-05:00'

Again, yourrower.txt and date string are optional. 
Because the SpeedCoach CSV file content doesn't have the row date, 
you may provide a date string. The tool should be quite forgiving regarding 
the exact format in which you write your date/time string. However, if
you input something ambiguous (time zone), the tool will guess 
and your row may end up on the wrong date. 
If nothing is provided, today's date will be taken.

RowPro
---------------------

Having RowPro exported data in testdata.csv, 
the following will create plots and
spit out some summary text ::

	$ rowproplot testdata.csv yourrower.txt

or ::

	$ rowproplottime testdata.csv yourrower.txt

The yourrower.txt argument is the file where you keep your rower data. 
This is optional. If you don't provide it, the tool will look for 
defaultrower.txt. If it doesn't find that, it will use some default values. 

For RowPro CSV files, upload to C2 logbook is not available on the command 
line. You can upload to C2 directly from the RowPro application.

ErgData
---------------------

If you use ErgData, you can download a CSV file from your Concept2 log. 
Here is how you use those data in this tool: ::

	$ ergdataplot testdata.csv yourrower.txt

or ::

	$ ergdataplottime testdata.csv yourrower.txt

The yourrower.txt argument is the file where you keep your rower data. 
This is optional. If you don't provide it, the tool will look for 
defaultrower.txt. If it doesn't find that, it will use some default values. 

As your data are already on the Concept2 logbook, it doesn't make sense to 
have a script to upload them once more.

However, you may appreciate creating a TCX file for uploading to SportTracks.mobi or Strava: ::

	$ ergdatatotcx testdata.csv

This will create a file testdata.csv_o.tcx which you can upload. I have tested 
this file on Strava and SportTracks with success. Somehow, even though the 
resulting file validates against the TCX Schema, I wasn't able to upload the file to Garmin Connect, because Garmin Connect rejects TCX files from non-Garmin devices.

ErgStick
---------------------

If you use ErgStick, you can download a CSV file from your Concept2 log. 
Here is how you use those data in this tool: ::

	$ ergstickplot testdata.csv yourrower.txt

or ::

	$ ergstickplottime testdata.csv yourrower.txt

The yourrower.txt argument is the file where you keep your rower data. 
This is optional. If you don't provide it, the tool will look for 
defaultrower.txt. If it doesn't find that, it will use some default values. 

As your data are already on the Concept2 logbook, it doesn't make sense to 
have a script to upload them once more.

However, you may appreciate creating a TCX file for uploading to SportTracks.mobi or Strava: ::

	$ ergsticktotcx testdata.csv

This will create a file testdata.csv_o.tcx which you can upload. I have tested 
this file on Strava and SportTracks with success. Somehow, even though the 
resulting file validates against the TCX Schema, I wasn't able to upload the file to Garmin Connect.

Copying to clipboard
---------------------

From the command-line, this only works on windows: ::

	$ copystats testdata.csv yourrower.txt



==============================
Directly in Python
==============================

Beta. Use with caution. 


Import
---------

Import the package

>>> import rowingdata

Your personal data
-----------------------

The old and difficult way
.............................

If you're not me (or have identical heart rate thresholds), 
you will have to change the default values for the rower. For example:

>>> john = rowingdata.rower(hrut2=100,hrut1=120,hrat=140,hrtr=150,hran=170,hrmax=180,c2username="johntherower",c2password="caughtacrab")

You can store this locally like this

>>> john.write("johnsdata.txt")

Then you can load this like this

>>> john = rowingdata.read_obj("johnsdata.txt")

The new and easy way
.............................

Since version 0.65 there are easier ways.

Create a new rower through some interactive Q&A:

>>> rowingdata.roweredit("johnsdata.txt")

If you omit the file name, it will default to "defaultrower.txt"

>>> john = rowingdata.getrower("johnsdata.txt")

If you want to change John's data, again just type:

>>> rowingdata.roweredit("johnsdata.txt")

Painsled iOS
----------------

To use with Painsled iOS CSV data, simply do

>>> row = rowingdata.rowingdata("testdata.csv",rower=myrower)
>>> row.plotmeters_erg()
>>> print row.allstats()

RowPro
-----------------

To use with RowPro CSV data, simply do

>>> rp = rowingdata.RowProParser("RP_testdata.csv")
>>> rp.write_csv("example_data.csv")
>>> row = rowingdata.rowingdata("example_data.csv")
>>> row.plotmeters_erg()
>>> row.plottime_erg()
>>> print row.summary()

SpeedCoach
-----------------

To use with SpeedCoach CSV data, simply do

>>> sc = rowingdata.speedcoachParser("RP_testdata.csv")
>>> sc.write_csv("example_data.csv")
>>> row = rowingdata.rowingdata(open("example_data.csv"))
>>> row.plotmeters_erg()
>>> row.plottime_erg()
>>> print row.summary()

CrewNerd (and other TCX)
---------------------------

To use with CrewNerd TCX data, simply do

>>> tcx = rowingdata.TCXParser("2016-03-25-0758.tcx")
>>> tcx.write_csv("example_data.csv")
>>> row = rowingdata.rowingdata(open("example_data.csv"),rower=myrower)
>>> row.plotmeters_otw()
>>> row.plottime_otw()
>>> print row.summary()

Other useful stuff
----------------------------

To get any data column as a numpy array, use (for example for HR data - 
see list below for other accessible data fields).

>>> row.getvalues[' HRCur (bpm)']

Of course you have access to the entire data frame as well:

>>> df = row.df
>>> df.describe

To create the colorful plots,
assuming you have a summary file from CrewNerd called 2016-03-25-0758.CSV and 
a TCX file called 2016-03-25-0758.TCX

>>> rowingdata.dorowall("2016-03-25-0758")

Plots and statistics

>>> row.uploadtoc2()

This will upload your row to Concept2 logbook. It just simply fill the online 
form for you. So nothing more than total distance and duration, date, weight 
category and row type.

Export or re-export to a tcx file is done with 

>>> row.exporttotcx("test.tcx")

With the package at your full disposal, the sky is the limit. You can do any 
plot you like or do other statistics, like calculate your average stroke length
including error margin, etc.

==============
Data Fields
==============

The available data fields are

* 'Timestamp (sec)'
* ' Horizontal (meters)'
* ' Cadence (stokes/min'
* ' HRCur (bpm)'
* ' Stroke500mPace (sec/500m)'
* ' Power (watts)'

======================
Known bugs
======================

* Copy to clipboard doesn't work from command-line on Linux, OS X
* The summary statistics don't work well when you use the TCX from Rowing in Motion (RIM). 
* RowProParser doesn't read the header information. Total row time reported by the tool is shorter by about half a stroke. Also there are a few meters missing. As RowPro has its own upload to C2 log, I didn't fix this bug. I guess RowPro users would use the tool mainly for plotting.
* The TCX created from the CSV doesn't work upload to Garmin Connect. This is not a bug. It's Garmin's policy to not accept TCX from non-Garmin devices.


=======================
Future functionality
=======================

* Add support for other erg software tools (just need the csv/tcx and it will be easy) 

	* Done for generic TCX

	* Done for CSV from SpeedCoach

	* Done for RowPro

	* Done for ErgData

	* Done for ErgStick


* Come up with a way to add Watts to the rowing plots - Done in EXPERIMENTAL mode

* Use the C2 logbook API and add splits and other data to the workout on the Concept2 logbook
