   * - Feature
     - Supported?
     - Description
   * - Device Connectivity
     - Yes
     - Connect your device(s) to Watson IoT Platform with ease using this library. Refer to `documentation <https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/devices/libraries/python.html>`_ for more details. 
   * - Gateway Connectivity
     - Yes
     - Connect your gateway(s) to Watson IoT Platform with ease using this library. Refer to `documentation <https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-python/blob/master/docs/Gateway.rst>`_ for more details.
   * - Application connectivity
     - Yes
     - Connect your application(s) to Watson IoT Platform with ease using this library. Refer to `documentation <https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/libraries/python.html>`_ for more details.
   * - Watson IoT API
     - Yes
     - Shows how applications can use this library to interact with the Watson IoT Platform through REST APIs. Refer to `documentation <https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/libraries/python.html>`_ for more details. 
   * - SSL/TLS
     - Yes
     - By default, this library connects your devices, gateways and applications securely to Watson IoT Platform registered service. Ports 8883(default one) and 443 support secure connections using TLS with the MQTT and HTTP protocol. Also, note that the library uses port 1883(unsecured) to connect to the Quickstart service. Support for MQTT with TLS requires at least Python v2.7.9 or v3.4, and openssl v1.0.1.
   * - Client side Certificate based authentication
     - No
     - `Client side Certificate based authentication <https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/reference/security/RM_security.html>`_ not supported now and will be added soon
   * - Device Management for Devices
     - Yes
     - Connects your device(s) as managed device(s) to Watson IoT Platform. Refer to `Managed Device documentation <https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-python/blob/master/docs/python_cli_for_manageddevice.rst>`_ for more details.
   * - Device Management for Gateways
     - Yes
     - Connects your gateway(s) as managed gateway(s) to Watson IoT Platform. Refer to `Managed Gateway documentation <https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-python/blob/master/docs/GatewayManagement.rst>`_ for more details.
   * - Device Management Extension
     - Yes
     - Provides support for custom device management actions. Refer to Device Management Extension(DME) Packages section in the `documentation <https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-python/blob/master/docs/python_cli_for_manageddevice.rst>`_ for more details.
