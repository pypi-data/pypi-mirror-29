This is a DKIM signing and verification milter.  In theory it works with both
Postfix and Sendmail, but the author has zero experience with Sendmail, so
reports of success/failure with Sendmail and patches are welcom.

The configuration file is designed to be compatible with OpenDKIM, but only
a subset of OpenDKIM options are supported.  If an unsupported option is
specified, an error will be raised.

This package includes a default configuration file and man pages.  For those
to be installed when installing using setup.py, the following incantation is
required because setuptools developers decided not being able to do this by
default is a feature:

python setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record=/dev/null

For users of Debian Stable (Debian 9, Codename Squueze), all dependencies are
available in either the main or backports repositories:

[sudo] apt install python-milter python-nacl
[sudo] apt install -t squeeze-backports python-authres python-dkim

The preferred method of installation is from PyPi using pip:

[sudo] pip install dkimpy_milter

Using pip will cause required packages to be installed via easy_install if they
have not been previously installed.

Both a systemd unit file and a sysv init file are provided.  Both make
assumptions about defaults being used, e.g. if a non-standard pidfile name is
used, they will need to be updated.  The sysv init file is Debian specific and
untested, since the developers are not using sysv init.  Feedback/patches
welcome.

The python DKIM library, dkimpy, requires the entire message being signed or
verified to be in memory, so dkimpy-milter does not write messages out to a temp
file.  This may impact performance on low-memory systems.

WARNING: This is an alpha grade release to support interoperability testing with
Ed25519 signatures and basic functionality.  It is known to be incomplete and
not suitable for general use.
