Description: Gapy
        ====
        
        Gapy is a thin service account client for Google Analytics.
        
        Get set up
        ----------
        
        First you need to create either a `service account <https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount>`_ or client ID in your
        `Google API Console <https://code.google.com/apis/console>`_. If you're
        authenticating as a service account you'll need to download your private key.
        
        If you're authenticating as a web or installed application you'll need to
        download your client secrets file. Use the `Google Developers Console <https://console.developers.google.com/>`_ to do this:
        
        - Create a Project for thte application, and add the Analytics API to the Enabled APIs list.
        - In "Credentials", click "Create new Client ID".
        - Choose "Installed Application" and type should be "Other".
        - Once it's generated your ID, click the new "Download JSON" button and save this file as client_secrets.json.
        
        Then just create a gapy client and start querying.
        
        - `storage_path` is the location where you want gapy to keep the `storage.db` file that it will generate the first time it runs.
        - Ids, metrics and dimensions can be provided as lists or single values.
        
        
        .. code :: python
        
            import gapy.client
        
            # For a service account
            client = gapy.client.from_private_key(
                "your account name",
                private_key="your private key",
                storage_path="path/to/storage.db")
        
            # For a web or installed application
            client = gapy.client.from_secrets_file(
                "/path/to/client_secrets.json",
                storage_path="/path/to/storage.db")
            )
        
        
            reach_data = client.query.get("12345",
                        datetime(2012, 1, 1),
                        datetime(2012, 2, 2),
                        ['ga:visits', 'ga:visitors'],
                        'ga:date')
