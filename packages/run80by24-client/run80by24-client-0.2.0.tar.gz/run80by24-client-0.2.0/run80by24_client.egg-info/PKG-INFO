        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Out of the box, the client generates a random passphrase and connects to `80by24.net`. This can be changed by
        putting a configuration file into `~/.80by24.conf` of the following form::
        
          host:       http://localhost:8080
          passphrase: correct horse battery staple
