        =======
        
        Python helper for authenticating in a DataONE environment.
        
        The d1_certificate library offers some routines to assist with authenticating for interactions with DataONE services.
        Authentication requires a web browser UI, and so is not suitable for use on headless systems. The basic process is:
        
        1. A web browser is opened to select an identity provider
        2. Credentials are entered into the selected IDP
        3. A certificate signing request is created and token information is retieved from CILogon
        4. The certificate is signed and moved to a consistent location.
        
        Caveats:
        
        1. A web browser is required
        2. It is assumed that the file downloaded by the web browser is located in ${HOME}/Downloads
        3. The generated certificate is placed into ${HOME}/.dataone/certificates
        4. The subject mapping and group info in the certificate is static. Be aware that the certificate will need to be
           regenerated if your user id mapping or group membership needs to change.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Release install::
        
          pip install -U d1login
        
        Development install::
        
          git clone
          cd d1Login
          pip install -U -e .
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        The commandline app will open a web browser at the appropriate login URL. After authenticating, the browser will
        download a ``.jnlp`` file. This should be placed in ~/Downloads. The script will be waiting (upto 60 seconds) for the
        ``.jnlp`` and once available, will process the file and request the certificate.
        
        Commandline::
        
          d1login
          <<browser opens, download jnlp file>>
          Certificate downloaded to: /Users/vieglais/.dataone/certificates/x509up_u501
        
        
        As a library::
        
            >>> import d1_certificate
            >>> service = d1_certificate.LOGIN_SERVICE['dev']
            >>> certpath = d1_certificate.login(overwrite=True, service=service)
            # Browser window opens for authentication
        
            >>> print certpath
            /Users/vieglais/.dataone/certificates/x509up_u501
        
            >>> d1_certificate.getSubjectFromCertFile( certpath )
            {'not_after': '20151216225323Z',
             'not_before': '20151216044823Z',
             'status': True,
             'subject': 'CN=Dave Vieglais A34511,O=Google,C=US,DC=cilogon,DC=org',
             'subject_info': None}
        
        On OS X, the certificate can then be imported into the keychain for browser interactions with nodes in the authenticated
        environment. For example::
        
            CERT=/Users/vieglais/.dataone/certificates/x509up_u501
            openssl x509 -outform der -in ${CERT} -out "${CERT}.der"
            security add-certificates "${CERT}.der"
        
        Now open a browser (chrome or safari, firefox uses it's own cert management independent of keychain)
        and visit the URL::
        
            https://cn-dev.test.dataone.org/cn/v2/diag/subject
        
        You should see your credentials in the xml response.
        
        On Yosemite, you can no longer use .pem format certificates to authenticate using curl
        [See: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2014-10/0053.html ]. Instead, convert to a .p12 format certificate and use that
        instead. Note of course, that entering your password on the command line like this is a security risk since it will
        appear in bash history, log files, and so forth. Example::
        
            CERT=/Users/vieglais/.dataone/certificates/x509up_u501
            openssl pkcs12 -export -in ${CERT} -out ${CERT}.p12 -passout pass:Some_Password
            curl -E ${CERT}.p12:Some_Password "https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/diag/subject"
