What is Taxi ?
==============

Taxi is a timesheeting tool that focuses on simplicity to help you write your
timesheets without wasting time. All you'll do is edit a text file and write
down what you've worked on and how long, like so::

    23/01/2014

    pingpong 09:00-10:00 Play ping-pong
    infra         -11:00 Repair coffee machine

You can then get a summary of your timesheet::

    Staging changes :

    # Thursday 23 january #
    pingpong (123/456)             1.00  Play ping-pong
    infra (123/42)                 1.00  Repair coffee machine
                                   2.00

    Total                          2.00

    Use `taxi ci` to commit staging changes to the server

Through the use of backends, Taxi allows you to push your timesheets to
different systems.
