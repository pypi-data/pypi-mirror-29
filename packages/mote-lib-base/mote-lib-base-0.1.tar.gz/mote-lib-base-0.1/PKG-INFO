Description: The base Mote pattern library
        ==============================
        
        Mote itself is only a framework for pattern libraries and doesn't provide
        any pattern libraries itself. The base library provides common patterns like
        buttons, anchors, panels, images and many more. Its aim is to provide a solid
        base for other pattern libraries.
        
        Base a pattern library on this base by setting the ``parents`` in a Mote project's
        metadata.yaml file:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            parents:
                - base
                - myproject
