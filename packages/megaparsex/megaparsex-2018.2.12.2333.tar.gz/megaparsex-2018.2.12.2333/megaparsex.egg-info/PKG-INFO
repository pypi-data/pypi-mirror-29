        introduction
        ============
        
        ``megaparsex`` is a Python module that features parsing and associated
        utilities. It features parsing functions that detect keyphrases in input
        text and that then return text, seek confirmations and run functions in
        response. It features functions that accept a list of parsing functions
        so that collections of parsing functions can be combined and new parsing
        functions can be added easily.
        
        It features a confirmation class that contains the ability to check
        responses for confirmation or denial while containing a function with
        optional keyword arguments to run on detection of confirmation together
        with optional specialized prompts and responses to confirmation and
        denial. It features a command class that contains the ability to request
        an input that is to be run as a command and to run that command, and
        contains a prompt.
        
        Some associated utilities are functions for manual input, to run system
        commands, to report IP information, to report weather information, to
        report system status, to restart a script, and to make a reverse-SSH
        connection.
        
        See example code for basic usage information.
        
        setup

            sudo pip install megaparsex
        
        coding ideas
        ============
        
        The multiparse function can combine a number of predefined or custom
        parser functions. Simple interactions involve responding to a single
        text input with text or by running a function. More complex interactions
        involve responding to a single text input but with a confirmation object
        which is used to ask for a confirmation before proceeding with defined
        actions. Still more complex interactions could involve nested parsers,
        whereby a parser or set of parsers is used to extract a response and
        that response can be used to propagate to nested parsers.
