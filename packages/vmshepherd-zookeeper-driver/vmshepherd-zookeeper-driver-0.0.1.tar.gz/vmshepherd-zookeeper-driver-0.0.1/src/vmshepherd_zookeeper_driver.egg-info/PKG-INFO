Description: vmshepherd-zookeeper-driver
        =====================
        
        Work in progress
        ----------------
        
        TODO
        
        - lock implementation
        - proper integration tests with docker
        
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Provides plugin for ``VmShepherd`` - driver allows to store runtime data and lock management in Zookeeper.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply use ``pip``.
        
        :: 
        
            pip install vmshepherd-zookeeper-driver
        
        
        Library requires (as well as VmShepherd itself) python 3.6 or later.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Install package (in the same environment as VmShepherd) and configure ``VmShepherd`` like:
        
        ::
        
            # ...
        
            runtime:
              driver: ZookeeperDriver
              driver_params:
                servers:
                 - some.zk.host
                working_path: /vmshepherd
                addauth:
                  auth: vmshepherduser:password
        
        
            # ...
