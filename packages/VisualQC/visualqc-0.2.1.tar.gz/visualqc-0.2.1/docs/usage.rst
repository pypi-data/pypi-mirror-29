Command line usage
------------------

The command line interface for ``visualqc`` is strongly recommended. If the installation was successful, options could be obtained by typing one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    visualqc
    visualqc -h


Those options are also shown below (may not always show up due to problems with software for auto generation of docs). Check the bottom of this page for examples.

.. argparse::
   :module: visualqc.vqc
   :func: get_parser
   :prog: visualqc
   :nodefault:
   :nodefaultconst:


Examples showing the usage of ``visualqc`` can be found at :doc:`examples`.
