[DEFAULT]
add.help = add new host alias by providing alias and host names
added.host = Added host connection "{host.username}@{host.addr}:{host.port}" with alias "{host.alias}"
added.ltun = Added local tunnel "{tunnel.lport}:{tunnel.tun_addr}:{tunnel.rport}" on host "{tunnel.host}" with alias "{tunnel.alias}"
addr.help = Any inet address that is used to connect
alias.help = unique identifier to use to add/del/connect etc.
app.desc = This is one simple damn ssh manager. The intend of this thing is to provide really simple use of the linux command line tool ssh that is NOT able to provide a ssh managing instance. Of course that would be named ssh-manager or something. Start with adding some host aliases that you want to connect to with the `add` command. These are needed of course to run a connection, but also for adding new tunnels.
connect.help = connect to one of your saved hosts by providing the alias
connect.type.help = choose one for the type you want to connect to. use this especially if one alias is used twice.
del.help = throw away all the garbage
del.type.help = type of the object you want to delete
err.no.local.port = cloud not find an open port, does your machine have a network interface card?
fmt.host = {host.alias:<20s}{host.username:<20s}{host.addr:<40s}{host.port:<5d}
fmt.host.header = {:<20s}{:<20s}{:<40s}{:<5s}
fmt.tunnel = {tunnel.alias:<20s}{tunnel.host:<20s}{tunnel.lport:<15d}{tunnel.tun_addr:<40s}{tunnel.rport:<15d}
fmt.tunnel.header = {:<20s}{:<20s}{:<15s}{:<40s}{:<15s}
host.alias.help = alias of the host connection that the tunnel runs on
host.tun.help = dns, ip or whatever where the tunnel is run on
list.help = List all objects (hosts and tunnels...) that where saved.
list.type.help = choose one for the type you want to list
local.port.help = local port used on the tunnel. if not provided a random open port on this machine is used.
ltun.help = Add a new local tunnel for a existing host alias. The host must have been added via add command. This is a shortcut for ssh -L 1234:host:4321 damn@some.host
port.help = port that target host uses for ssh (22 by default)
remote.port.help = remote port used on the tunnel
username.help = username parameter to connect to the host. By default this is the login name (os.getlogin())
