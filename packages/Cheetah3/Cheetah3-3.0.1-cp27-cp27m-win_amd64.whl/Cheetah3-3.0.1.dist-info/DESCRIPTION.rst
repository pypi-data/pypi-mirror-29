Cheetah3 is a free (BSD-style) and open source template engine and code
generation tool.

It can be used standalone or combined with other tools and frameworks. Web
development is its principle use, but Cheetah is very flexible and is also being
used to generate C++ game code, Java, sql, form emails and even Python code.

It's a fork of the original CheetahTemplate library.
