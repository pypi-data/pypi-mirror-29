[SIMPHY-PARTITIONS] simple [1 simple_unlinked 500] //// The first half of the gene families will evolve under the model "simple_unlinked". Their sequence lengths are sampled from a Normal with mean=1000 and sd=100.
[SIMPHY-EVOLVE] 1 data // One sequence alignment for each gene tree, saved in files with "dataset" as common prefix (it will generate dataset_1, dataset_2, etc.)
