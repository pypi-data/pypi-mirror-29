@Builder.register(Network)  # noqa: C901
def build_network(model, network, progress_bar=False):
    """Builds a `.Network` object into a model.

    The network builder does this by mapping each high-level object to its
    associated signals and operators one-by-one, in the following order:

    1. Ensembles, nodes, neurons
    2. Subnetworks (recursively)
    3. Connections, learning rules
    4. Probes

    Before calling any of the individual objects' build functions, random
    number seeds are assigned to objects that did not have a seed explicitly
    set by the user. Whether the seed was assigned manually or automatically
    is tracked, and the decoder cache is only used when the seed is assigned
    manually.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : Model
        The model to build into.
    network : Network
        The network to build.
    progress_bar : bool or `.ProgressBar` or `.ProgressUpdater`, optional \
                   (Default: False)
        Progress bar for displaying build progress.

        If True, the default progress bar will be used.
        If False, the progress bar will be disabled.
        For more control over the progress bar, pass in a `.ProgressBar`
        or `.ProgressUpdater` instance.

        Note that this will only affect top-level networks. Subnetworks
        cannot have progress bars displayed.

    Notes
    -----
    Sets ``model.params[network]`` to ``None``.
