        Register new trait validators

        Validators are functions that take two arguments.
         - The trait instance
         - The proposed value

        Validators return the (potentially modified) value, which is either
        assigned to the HasTraits attribute or input into the next validator.

        They are evaluated in the order in which they are provided to the `valid`
        function.
