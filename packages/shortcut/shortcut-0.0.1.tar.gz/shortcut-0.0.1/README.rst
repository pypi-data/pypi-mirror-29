Shortcut
========

Shortcut is a cross platform command line application and API for creating shortcuts.

Shortcut will do its best to find your app, searching for the usual suspects in the usual places (i.e. those in the PATH), or you can give it a full path.

To create desktop and menu shortcuts for ``python``: 

- Using the app:: 

    shortcut python 

- Using the Python API::

    from shortcut import ShortCutter
    s = ShortCutter()
    s.create_desktop_shortcut("python")
    s.create_menu_shortcut("python")

It was created to solve a simple problem - if you install a python package using pip there is no simple way of creating a shortcut to the program it installs.
