This is the evoke clone app, as used by the evoke/clone_app script as the basis for a new app

Each evoke clone app is also itself a twisted application.

The site/app folder contains whatever flat files are to be served by twisted/evoke.

Before starting this app, you will need a config_site.py - refer to the config_site.py.example.
