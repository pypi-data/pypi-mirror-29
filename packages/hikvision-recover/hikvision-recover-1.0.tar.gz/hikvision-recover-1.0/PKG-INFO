Description: Normally, to reset a hikvision camera you contact their support department to generate a recovery code. However, the method they use to do this has been cracked. This source code will generate the proper recovery code when provided the camera's serial number and current time reported by the camera.

        ```python
        from hikvision_recover.recover import get_code
        
        serial = "DS-ABC1234567-HIJKLMNOPQRS10987654321"
        year = "2017"
        month = "01"
        day = "25"
        revoery_code = get_code(serial, year, month, day)
        print(revoery_code)
        
        ```
