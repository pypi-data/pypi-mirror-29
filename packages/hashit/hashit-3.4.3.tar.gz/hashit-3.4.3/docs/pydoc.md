<h1 id="hashit">hashit</h1>

hashit module for hashit command is contaning all the code for hashit

hashit is an hashing application which main purpose is to replace all the 'default'
hashing commands that comes with linux and also provide a usable hashing program
for windows hence the choice of using python. while hashit supports both python 2 and 3
i would strongly recommend using python3 because that python3 comes with a newer version
of hashlib and therefore many new hash-functions, altough it is posible to add these into
python2 with the load() function which acts like a 'connecter' and enables hashit to use
third-party hashing-functions as long as the have the same api as specified in docs/index.md

The GLOBAL dict contains all the configurations for this program, translations, error messages
settings, plugins and more.

__algorithms__ is a list that contains all the builtin algorithms including crc32

<h2 id="hashit.load_all">load_all</h2>

```python
load_all(list_of_hashclasses)
```
Just for it, a function that loads all plugins in a list
<h2 id="hashit.choose_hash">choose_hash</h2>

```python
choose_hash(hash1, hashit)
```

Uses detect.decect to identify hashes with a high accuracy but when
there if some issues it will take user input. CLI-only

<h2 id="hashit.detect_format">detect_format</h2>

```python
detect_format(hashstr, use_size=False)
```
Autodetect hash format, by checking the length and what it contains
<h2 id="hashit.new">new</h2>

```python
new(hashname, data=b'')
```
Custom hash-init function that returns the hashes
    depends on hashlib.new and GLOBAL["EXTRA"]. One of its'
    features is it's support for the python3 only shake-hash
    scheme were the default hash is shake_256 and the input is
    taken like this:
        shake_[amount of output]
<h2 id="hashit.reader">reader</h2>

```python
reader(filename, mode='r', comments=True, newlines=False)
```
Creates generator for an file, better for larger files not part of the MEMOPT,
    so an standard reader for most uses. Works like readlines but instead of a list it
    creates an generator that sortof clean the input before it is parsed by something like
    BSD() or SFV().
<h2 id="hashit.eprint">eprint</h2>

```python
eprint(*args, **kwargs)
```
Prints to stderr usefull for warnings and error messages
<h2 id="hashit.hashFile">hashFile</h2>

```python
hashFile(filename, hasher, memory_opt=False)
```
hashFile is a simple way to hash files using diffrent methods
<h2 id="hashit.load">load</h2>

```python
load(hashclass)
```

Add hashes to GLOBAL.EXTRA which is the dict that contains all the "extra"
hash-functions such as Crc32, which allows external hashing algorithms to 
be used as long as the have the same api as specified in docs/README.md

returns True/False based on whether or not the data is loaded

<h2 id="hashit.check">check</h2>

```python
check(path, hashit, usecolors=False, be_quiet=False, detecthash=True, sfv=False, size=False, bsdtag=False, strict=False, trace=False, dry_run=False)
```
Uses check_() to print the error messages and statuses corrent (for CLI)
    they are seperated so that you can use the python api, if you so please.

<h2 id="hashit.supports_color">supports_color</h2>

```python
supports_color()
```

Returns True if the running system's terminal supports color, and False
otherwise.

<h2 id="hashit.blockIter">blockIter</h2>

```python
blockIter(afile, blocksize=65536)
```
Will create a generator for reading a file
<h2 id="hashit.check_files">check_files</h2>

```python
check_files(path, hashit, first_line, sfv=False, size=False, bsdtag=False, dry_run=False)
```
Will read an file which have a SFV compatible checksum-file or a standard one and verify the files checksum
    by creating an generator which loops over another generator which parses/reads the file and then it will check
    if the hash and optionally the size of the files matches the current state of them. For more info on how this work
    see docs/index.md`technical`.

<h2 id="hashit.fixpath">fixpath</h2>

```python
fixpath(path)
```
Fixpath converts the releative path into an absolute path
    and if needed can append the path to the snap host-filesystem 
    which if the application is in devmode gives hashit access to 
    the hole filesystem, if you're not in devmode and you're still
    using snap, then you will need sudo to access the intire system.
    Also replaces / with \ on windows
<h2 id="hashit.SFV">SFV</h2>

```python
SFV(self, filename=None, size=False)
```
Class for parsing and creating sfv strings
    SFV() contains all functions needed for parsing,
    creating and formating SFV strings
<h2 id="hashit.hashIter">hashIter</h2>

```python
hashIter(bytesiter, hasher, ashexstr=True)
```
Will hash the blockIter generator and return digest
<h2 id="hashit.BSD">BSD</h2>

```python
BSD(self, filename=None, size=False)
```
Parser for bsd and formater, also the
    same as SFV() but BSD() instead of sfv uses
    the bsd checksum output which is like this:
        hashname (filename) = hash [size]
<h1 id="hashit.__main__">hashit.__main__</h1>

Command line application for hashit

this module "__main__" contains all the code for argparsing, running
and anything needed for an command lin application such as hashit.

it uses argc another package by me, but i am considering switching to argparse

<h2 id="hashit.__main__.exclude">exclude</h2>

```python
exclude(items, excludes)
```
Exclude removes all items in a list that is in the excludes list (for dirs)
<h2 id="hashit.__main__.walk">walk</h2>

```python
walk(go_over)
```
Goes over a path an finds all files, appends them to a list and returns that list
<h2 id="hashit.__main__.Execute">Execute</h2>

```python
Execute(self, nargs=0, **kwargs)
```
Same as Print() but instead of printing an object it calls it takes func (function), and exit (bool)
<h2 id="hashit.__main__.main">main</h2>

```python
main(args=None)
```

Main function with error catching, can force-exit with os._exit(1)

this main function calls main_() and cathes any error while giving the user some "pretty"
errors.

<h2 id="hashit.__main__.main_">main_</h2>

```python
main_(args)
```
Main function which is the cli parses arguments and runs appropriate commands
<h2 id="hashit.__main__.config">config</h2>

```python
config(parser)
```
Sets argvs' config and commands with argparse and returns it for good sake
<h2 id="hashit.__main__.Print">Print</h2>

```python
Print(self, nargs=0, **kwargs)
```
Print action for argparse, takes one kwarg which is text the varible which contains the string to be printed
