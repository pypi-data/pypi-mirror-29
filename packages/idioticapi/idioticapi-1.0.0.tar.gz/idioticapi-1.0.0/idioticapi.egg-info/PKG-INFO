Description: # Idiotic-Wrapper (Python edition)
        This is an API wrapper for the [idiot's guide api](https://api.anidiots.guide)
        The wrapper is asynchronous and is hightly compatible with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) Being built with aiohttp that comes with discord.py you don't have to add extra dependencies!
        
        ## Example
        Retrieving image in a regular code
        ```python
        import idioticapi
        import asyncio
        
        client = idioticapi.Client("Your api key", dev=True)
        
        async def main():
            img = open("test.png", "wb")
            img.write(await client.blame("This person"))
            # untested though that's just what i think how it works shrug, its recommended to use it as a discord.py cog
            
        asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
        ```
        Discord.py example
        ```python
        import idioticapi
        # you want easy access to it so maybe attach it to your bot # object, this allowes access to cogs as well and you don't have to remake the class everywhere.
        bot.api = idioticapi.Client("Your api key", dev=True)
        
        @bot.command()
        async def blame(ctx, *, text):
            await ctx.send(file=discord.File(await bot.api.blame(text), "blame.png"))
        # a simple example, change it to whatever you like to fit in a cog etc, also works with old d.py 0.16.x just change the way i sent things, i didn't test though but SHOULD work
        ```
        More info
        Client takes a session as third argument, which you can reuse another session if you have one or leave it to create a new aiohttp.ClientSession()
